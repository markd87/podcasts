1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,860
I always used to misspell renaissance as I was typing it out at R-E-N and then I would sort of

2
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:10,400
like not really know what came from there but I learned a mnemonic to make sure I get it right

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,840
oh I thought you're gonna say you've typed it so many times now over the past month

4
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:20,280
well there's that too but you ready for this you can't spell renaissance without A-I

5
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,120
oh

6
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,380
touche touche

7
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,480
all right let's do it

8
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:35,040
who got the truth is it you is it you is it you who got the truth now

9
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:43,720
is it you is it you is it you sit me down say it straight another story on the way

10
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:51,040
welcome to season 14 episode 3 of acquired the podcast about great companies and the stories

11
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:56,020
and playbooks behind them i'm ben gilbert i'm david rosenthal and we are your hosts

12
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,300
they say david that as an

13
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:58,460
investor

14
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:05,120
you can't beat the market or time the market that you're better off indexing and dollar

15
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:10,720
cost averaging rather than trying to be an active stock picker they say there's no persistence of

16
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:16,000
returns for hedge funds that this year's big winner can be next year's big loser and that

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,800
nobody gets huge outperformance without taking huge risk when i was in college i actually took

18
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:26,800
an economics class with burton malkiel who of course you know was involved in starting vanguard

19
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,280
and is a big proponent of all that and i was in college and i was in college and i was in college

20
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,340
in all the part and i was the beginning of all that and that is what i learned ben

21
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:33,020
well david it turns out they were wrong

22
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:35,820
today listeners we tell the story

23
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:39,000
of the best performing investment firm in history

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,080
renaissance technologies or rentek

25
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:47,860
their 30-year track record managing billions of dollars has better returns than anyone you have

26
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:53,660
ever heard of including berkshire hathaway bridgewater george soros peter lynch or anyone

27
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:58,260
else so why haven't you heard of them or if you have why don't you know much about them

28
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:03,300
about them? Well, their eye-popping performance is matched only by their extreme secrecy,

29
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:09,480
and they are unusual in almost every way. Their founder, Jim Simons, worked for the U.S. government

30
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:15,000
in the Cold War as a codebreaker before starting Renaissance. None of the founders or early

31
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,560
employees had any investing background, and they built the entire thing by hiring PhD physicists,

32
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:26,040
astronomers, and speech recognition researchers. They're located in the middle of nowhere in a

33
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:31,240
tiny town on Long Island. They don't pay attention to revenues, profits, or even who the CEOs are of

34
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:35,880
the companies that they invest in. And at any given time, they probably couldn't even tell you

35
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:41,060
what actual stocks they own. Now, you may be thinking, okay, great, I just learned about this

36
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:47,380
insane fund with unbelievable performance. And to be specific, listeners, that's 66% annual returns

37
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:54,200
before fees. And, you know, well, I want to invest. Well, you can't. To add to everything else that I

38
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,940
just said, Rentex flagship

39
00:02:55,940 --> 00:03:00,620
medallion fund doesn't take any outside investors. The partners of the firm have

40
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:05,780
become so wealthy from the billions that the fund has generated that the only investors they allow

41
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:13,080
in are themselves. Oh, we are going to talk a lot about that towards the end of the episode,

42
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:19,200
because I think it's kind of the key to the whole thing. Ooh, cliffhanger, David. I'm excited. So

43
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:25,120
what exactly does Renaissance do? Why does it work? And how did it evolve to be the way it is today?

44
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:25,920
And while there's a lot of talk about it, there's a lot of talk about it. And I think it's a lot of

45
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:30,900
resources are out there are scarce because for one, employees sign a lifetime non-disclosure

46
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:35,760
agreement. David and I are going to take you through everything we've learned about the firm

47
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,420
from our research dating all the way back before Jim Simons started as a math professor

48
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:46,160
to understand it all. This episode was selected by our acquired limited partners. And to be honest,

49
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:51,140
I didn't think enough people knew what Rentex was to pick it. But when we put it out for a vote,

50
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:55,880
the people have spoken. So if you want to become a limited partner and pick one episode each season,

60
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:46,680
Novo episode if you liked that one. Before we dive in, we want to briefly share our presenting

61
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,980
sponsor this season is JP Morgan, specifically their incredible payments business.

62
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:55,680
Yeah, just like how we say every company has a story, every company's story is powered by

63
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,480
payments. And JP Morgan Payments is a part of so many companies that we talk about on Acquired.

64
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:06,100
It's not just the Fortune 500, too. They're also helping companies grow from seed to IPO and beyond.

65
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:10,880
Yep. So with that, the show is not investment advice. David and I may have investments in

66
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,780
the companies we discuss or perhaps wish we did. And this show is for informational

67
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:19,440
and entertainment purposes only. David, where do we start our story today?

68
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:24,940
Ah, well, we start in 1938 in Newton, Massachusetts.

69
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:31,940
Which is a fairly wealthy suburb just outside of Boston, where one James Simons is born.

70
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:39,000
Both of Jim's parents were very, very smart, especially his mother, Marsha. His dad was a

71
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,460
salesman for 20th Century Fox, the movie company. His job was he went around to theaters in the

72
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:49,980
Northeast and sold packages of movies to them. Super cool. By the way, we knew all this because

73
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:55,180
we have to thank Greg Zuckerman, author of The Man Who Solved the Market, which is the

74
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,680
book out there that is solely dedicated to Rentech and Jim Simons. And we actually got to talk to

75
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,000
Greg in our research. He helped us out a bunch. Thank you, Greg.

76
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:07,000
And help fact check a few of our assumptions of what happened after the book came out.

77
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:14,580
So that was Jim's parents. But really, a major influence on him growing up was his grandfather,

78
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:20,440
Marsha's dad. There's already kind of echoes of the Bezos story here with the grandfather,

79
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,660
the mother's father, and spending a bunch of time with him and rubbing off on young Jeff or

80
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:31,400
young Jim in this case. And Bezos, of course, would get his start in his career at D.E. Shaw.

81
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,960
A quant fund coming up at the same time as Rentech.

82
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:43,320
But back to Jim here in the 1940s, his grandfather, Peter, owned a shoe factory that made

83
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:49,740
women's dress shoes. Jim spends a ton of time there growing up at the factory. So Jim's grandfather,

84
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:55,540
Peter, was quite the character. He was a Russian immigrant, and he's,

85
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,620
kind of like, still more Russia than Boston at this point in time.

86
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:04,480
As Greg puts it in the book, Peter reveled in telling Jim and his cousins stories of the

87
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:10,720
motherland involving wolves, women, caviar, and vodka. And he teaches young Jim when he's a child

88
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:16,540
here in the factory to say Russian phrases like, give me a cigarette and kiss my ass.

89
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,340
Which I think he probably would say that thousands of times the rest of his life.

90
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:25,460
I think so. If you watch interviews with Jim, his hands are always twitching,

91
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:30,840
because he has chain-smoked his entire life, probably going back to, like, age 10 in the

92
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:36,520
factory. Three packs of merits a day. Unbelievable. Although I think he quit later in life, but he

93
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:40,000
definitely chain-smoked the better part of the first, call it, 75 years or something.

94
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:45,020
I mean, these famous stories of the conference rooms at Rentech and the war rooms when the

95
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:49,300
market is going through, like, a crazy gyration and it's just filled with cigarette smoke and

96
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:55,520
it's all Jim. Different time. Different time. So back to Jim's childhood, though, here in the,

97
00:07:55,540 --> 00:08:02,480
like, Boston suburbs. He grows up certainly not uber-wealthy or uber-rich, but very, very solidly

98
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:07,240
upper-middle class. And especially, he's an only child. He has all the resources of his parents,

99
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:12,420
his family, his grandfather's this sort of well-to-do entrepreneur. And Jim, you know,

100
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:18,840
he gets to rub shoulders in the Boston area with people who are really rich. And he says later,

101
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,340
I observed that it's very nice to be rich. I had no interest in business, which is not to say I

102
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,500
had no interest in money.

103
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,000
Yes. Important to tease out the difference between those two things.

104
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:33,900
Yes. Very, very important. And what he means when he says he has no interest in business,

105
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:41,280
it's because from a pretty young age, he gets really into math. So the legend has it when Jim

106
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:46,800
is four years old, he stumbles into one of Zeno's famous paradoxes from ancient Greek times.

107
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:53,000
Yep. This is great. The basic gist of Zeno's paradox is if you are always taking a quantity

108
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,520
and dividing it by two, you will never get the same amount of money. And that's why he's so

109
00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:01,240
zero. You will asymptotically approach zero, but you will never actually touch zero. You need to do

110
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:06,420
addition or subtraction to do that. Division won't cut it. And so Jim, as a four-year-old,

111
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:11,840
when he observes they need to go to the gas station to fill up the tank, he throws out the idea,

112
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:18,180
well, let's just use only half the gas in the tank because then we'll still be able to after

113
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:21,940
that only use half the gas in the tank. And, you know, the funny thing that doesn't occur to a

114
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:24,780
four-year-old is, well, then we're just not going to get very far.

115
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:31,520
So Jim's dream is to go to MIT down the street in Cambridge and study math. He graduates high

116
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:36,580
school in three years. And during the second semester of Jim's freshman year there, he

117
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:42,360
enrolls in a graduate math seminar on abstract algebra. So pretty, you know, heady stuff.

118
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:48,580
Yeah. And Jim would go on to finish his undergrad at MIT in three years and get a master's in one

119
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:54,640
year. Yeah. Pretty, pretty smart. But it turns out that that freshman year grad seminar,

120
00:09:54,640 --> 00:10:01,020
he took, actually has a big impact on him because he doesn't do well in the class. He can't keep up.

121
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:08,220
And Jim's pretty self-aware here. There are other people at MIT who never run into problems.

122
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:14,840
They never hit a limit. They never struggle understanding any concept. And he realizes that,

123
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,480
oh, I'm smart. I'm very, very smart. I'm smarter than most other people here.

124
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,000
But I'm not one of those people. Right. Which is, you know,

125
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,620
what do you do with that?

126
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:29,780
You realize you have to add a few of your skills together to become the best at something. You have

127
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:34,480
to be smart and something else. Yes. So Jim's own words on this are,

128
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:38,580
I was a good mathematician. I wasn't the greatest in the world, but I was pretty good.

129
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,820
But he recognizes, like you said, Ben, that he has a different advantage

130
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:47,580
that most of the super geniuses lacked. And that's that, as he put it, he had good taste.

131
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:53,760
So these are his words. Taste in science is very important. To distinguish what's a good problem

132
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,200
and what's a problem that's not, that's not true. And that's the best advantage that Jim has.

133
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:59,140
what's a problem that no one's going to care about the answer to anyway. That's taste. And I think I

134
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:06,100
have good taste. By the way, this is exactly the same thing as Jeff Bezos in college realizing he

135
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:12,120
wanted to be a theoretical physicist. He met some of the extreme brainpower people that would go on

136
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:16,240
to become the best theoretical physicist in the world. And he said, I'm smart, but I'm not that

137
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:23,760
smart. And so switch to computer science. I think the analogy here is like sports. There are all

138
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:30,700
star players. There are Hall of Famers. And then there's LeBron and MJ. And Jim ends up being a

139
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:35,560
Hall of Famer mathematician, but he's not Tom Brady. I mean, he's got a pretty important theorem

140
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:39,880
named after him. That goes on to become a foundation of string theory and physics, which

141
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:46,520
isn't even Jim's field. Crazy. So this realization that Jim has about himself, though, both that he's

142
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:52,680
not the smartest person in the room at a place like MIT, but he can hang with them and that he

143
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,400
has this.

144
00:11:53,760 --> 00:12:00,760
Taste concept, I think, becomes one of the most important keys to the secret sauce that ends up

145
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:07,460
getting built at Rentech, which is that he can relate to everybody. He understands what's going

146
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:11,820
on. Any person off the street probably couldn't even really have a conversation with these folks,

147
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:18,340
but he can. And yet he also has the perspective. Maybe some of this is from his grandfather of

148
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:23,740
what is important out there in the real world. And as a result, all of his friends at MIT,

149
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:30,020
and these super smart people, they look up to him because you aren't like the kid in the corner at

150
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:34,020
the high school dance. You're cool. He's the extroverted theoretical mathematician.

151
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:40,660
Yes. So he was elected class president in high school. You know, he smokes cigarettes. He's

152
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:46,060
popular with the ladies. He kind of looks like Humphrey Bogart. He's a popular dude,

153
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:50,180
especially at this point in time. We're now in the late 50s when Jim's at MIT.

154
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:53,740
You know, this is kind of James Dean rebel without a cause.

155
00:12:53,760 --> 00:13:02,100
Yep. So after graduation, Jim leads his buddies on a road trip with motor scooters.

156
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:07,600
You can't make this stuff up from Boston down to Bogota, where one of his classmates is from.

157
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:11,980
The idea is that they're going to do something so epic that the newspapers are going to have

158
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:17,460
to write about it. So they all load up on scooters and drive down to Bogota. They get

159
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:21,920
into all sorts of adventures. There's knives and guns and they get thrown in jail.

160
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,540
It's honestly crazy that,

161
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,620
this group of people took this type of risk.

162
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,420
Totally crazy. So after he's done at MIT and after the road trip,

163
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:36,460
Jim heads out to Berkeley in California so that he could do his PhD with the professor

164
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:43,280
Xingxian Chern. And much later in life, Jim would collaborate with Chern for the Chern-Simons

165
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,740
theory that we talked about earlier that becomes one of the foundational parts of

166
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:52,700
string theory in physics. But before Jim leaves for the West Coast, he meets a girl in Boston

167
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,740
and they do a little bit of a talk. And she's like, I'm going to do a little bit of a talk.

168
00:13:53,740 --> 00:14:01,540
So they decide to get engaged in four days. I mean, this is, this is him back then. These

169
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:09,600
were the times. And when they get to California and they get married, Jim takes the $5,000 wedding

170
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:15,520
gift that I believe they got from her parents. And he decides, I want to multiply this. So he

171
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:20,780
starts driving from Berkeley into San Francisco every morning to go hang out at the Merrill Lynch

172
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:23,560
brokerage office and just be a rat.

173
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:23,720
And he's like, I'm going to do a little bit of a talk. And he's like, I'm going to do a little bit of a talk.

174
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:27,180
So they start driving around the brokerage and find ways to trade and turn this money into

175
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:30,900
something more. Which is so interesting to think about because at that point in time,

176
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,560
there was such an advantage to just being there. This wasn't even the trading floor,

177
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:40,280
but information is all so manual and also relationship driven in the markets

178
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:44,720
that there was basically no way to be in on the action unless you were physically there

179
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:50,020
in on the action. Exactly. Yeah. You couldn't just log into Yahoo finance or something or

180
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:53,540
open the stocks app on your iPhone, which even the information they were

181
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:58,200
getting was God knows how long delayed from New York or from Chicago for the futures and

182
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:02,820
commodities that are being traded that Jim gets into. He's as close to the action as he can

183
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:09,120
possibly be, but he's a long, long way from the action. Yep. Nonetheless, when he starts out

184
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:15,800
doing this, Jim hits a hot streak and he goes up 50% in a few days. Trading is easy.

185
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:22,660
Trading is easy. He says, I was hooked. It was kind of a rush. I bet. Except he ends up losing

186
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:27,340
all of his profits just as quickly. Yeah. Important to learn that lesson early.

187
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:33,020
Yes. And also right around this time, Barbara, his wife, gets pregnant with their first child

188
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:38,180
and is like, you can't be driving into San Francisco every morning at gambling our future

189
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:44,500
like this. Right. Effectively playing the ponies. Yeah, exactly. So Jim's like, okay, okay. I'll

190
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:50,780
stop. I'll focus on academia for now. So he finishes his PhD in two years. They come back

191
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,500
to Boston and he joins MIT.

192
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:59,300
As a junior professor at age 23. So they stay one year in Boston, but Jim, even though he's got a

193
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:05,240
family, even though he's super successful as a young academic here, he's got kids, he's restless.

194
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:11,000
So one of his buddies from the scooter trip to Bogota is from Bogota and lives there. His family's

195
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:17,160
there. He has an idea to start a flooring tile manufacturing company because he's like, you know,

196
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:21,800
the flooring at MIT and in Boston, it's so much nicer than a Bogota. We should start a company and

197
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,640
make this.

198
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:23,960
Same kind of flooring here.

199
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:30,280
When I read this, I couldn't believe that this was Jim Simon's first business venture. Like it's so

200
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:35,920
random, but it really is emblematic of just how much he was thrill-seeking and just looking for

201
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:41,080
anything that was unexpected, different, exciting. He just gets bored fast.

202
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:45,920
Totally. Not just is this the start of his entrepreneurial career,

203
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:50,420
the seeds of this financially are what go on to start Rentech.

204
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,080
It's wild.

205
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:55,560
Totally wild. So Jim takes a year off and goes down to Bogota.

206
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:03,960
This is a guy with an MIT undergrad and master's and a Berkeley PhD in theoretical math.

207
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:06,020
Who's now a professor at MIT.

208
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,600
Who is taking a year off to go work on a flooring company in Bogota.

209
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,480
Yes. Accurate. So he does that for a year. They get it set up. He gets bored again. He's like,

210
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,980
all right, I don't want to just run this company. I've helped set it up. I have an ownership stake

211
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:20,320
in it now. He bounces back.

212
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:25,360
To Boston, this time to Harvard as a professor there for a year.

213
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,600
He's really racking them up.

214
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:32,180
But he spends a year there and he's like, ah, got the itch again. And you know,

215
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:37,360
the junior professor's salary isn't that much. And like we said about him back from his childhood

216
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,780
days, he sees the appeal in being rich. And he's like, this is not a path to being rich.

217
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:49,840
So he's like, I'm going to go put my skills out on the open market. He gets a job in Princeton,

218
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
New Jersey, not at Princeton.

219
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,060
Princeton, New Jersey, not at Princeton, New Jersey, not at Princeton, New Jersey, not at Princeton,

220
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:59,880
University, but at the Institute for Defense Analyses, which is a nonprofit organization

221
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:07,740
that consults exclusively for the U.S. government, specifically the Defense Department,

222
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:14,260
and specifically the NSA. These are the civilian codebreakers.

223
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:20,160
Yes. It was basically formed with this idea that one, across various branches of our government,

224
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:20,980
we need to be able to do this. And so we're going to do this. And we're going to do this. And we're

225
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:27,100
going to need better collaboration and crossfunding of the same initiatives. And two, there are going

226
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:31,120
to be a lot of people who don't work for the government that we're going to want to hire to do

227
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:36,640
some pretty secret work. Yep. So the IDA there in Princeton

228
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:42,600
kind of functioned like the Institute for Advanced Study, which is also in Princeton.

229
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:48,400
That's where Einstein went when he came to America, kind of an independent think tank research group,

230
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,840
except it's solely focused on...

231
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:55,200
Codebreaking and signal intelligence with the Russians during the Cold War.

232
00:18:55,660 --> 00:19:01,220
Yeah. It's a pretty wild charter, and especially how special of an organization it was. The way

233
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:06,880
these people would spend their time is part codebreaking, but part kind of goofing around

234
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,440
because the creativity of mathematicians working together on passion projects

235
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:19,440
is important to discovering clever new algorithms. Yes. This is so, so key. And this culture

236
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,960
ends up getting translated into a lot of other things. And I think it's a really important

237
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:21,140
thing.

238
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:21,160
Yeah.

239
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,000
And I think it's a really important thing.

240
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,960
They recruited top mathematicians and academics to come be codebreakers there. They would double

241
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,700
their salaries.

242
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:39,280
And importantly, it couldn't have been a government division if they were going to

243
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:44,100
be doing that because there's very specific congressionally approved budgets for payroll.

244
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:49,940
Exactly. They figured out that they needed to attract the smartest people in the world who

245
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:50,860
weren't going to come just go...

246
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:56,640
go work for the Department of Defense. This was the way to do it. So like you said, Ben,

247
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:02,420
the charter of the group was that employees had to spend 50% of their time doing code breaking.

248
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:08,480
But the other 50% of the time, they were free to do whatever they wanted, like research,

249
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:14,860
pursue whatever they were doing in academia, publish papers. Kind of the appeal of going

250
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:20,420
there was, hey, it's the same thing as being a professor at MIT or Princeton or Harvard or

251
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:26,160
whatever, except you're doing code breaking instead of teaching. And there's no bureaucracy

252
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:31,480
to worry about. There's no politics. It's just like, hey, you do your code breaking work and

253
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:36,940
then you publish it. You can collaborate with your colleagues there. Now, this is pretty crazy.

254
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:44,000
Very quickly after Jim arrives at IDA, remember, he's in moneymaking mode at this point in time.

255
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:50,400
He recruits a bunch of his very brilliant colleagues to come work with him in

256
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:58,440
their 50% free time on an idea to apply the same work and technologies that they're using in

257
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:06,060
code breaking and signal intelligence to trading in the stock market. So they come together and

258
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:12,260
they publish a paper called Probabilistic Models for and Prediction of Stock Market Behavior.

259
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:19,840
And everything that they suggest in this paper really is rent tech. Just,

260
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,740
20 years before rent tech. It's crazy. 1964, this was published?

261
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:32,680
Yes. Now, at this point in time, fundamental analysis was then, as in most of the world

262
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:38,220
today, still is the primary way of investing in things of, hey, I know this company. I'm

263
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:43,060
going to analyze their revenues, their price multiple, or I'm going to think about what's

264
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:48,520
happening in the currency markets or in the commodity markets and why copper is moving here

265
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,360
or the British pound is moving there.

266
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,260
I'm going to invest on those insights.

267
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,300
You're effectively looking at the intrinsic value of an asset,

268
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,620
trying to assign it a value and make investments based on that.

269
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:08,840
Yes. Fundamental investing. There also existed in the 60s, technical investing, which kind of is

270
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:16,880
voodoo. This is like, I'm looking at a stock chart and I've got a feeling that it's going to go up.

271
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,120
I'm tracing this pattern and it's going up, baby. Or,

272
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:20,380
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

273
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,020
This pattern is going down.

274
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,740
Yeah. Using the phrase technical might be a little generous,

275
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:31,640
but what they're looking for basically trying to mine trading behavior for signal about the way

276
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:36,380
that it will trade in the future, rather than mining the intrinsic information about an asset

277
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:40,740
for what you think it will do in the future. Right. And what Jim and his colleagues here

278
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:50,180
suggesting is that, but just not really done by humans. It's that with a lot more data and a lot

279
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:55,660
more sophisticated signal processing. And importantly, you might say, why is it this

280
00:22:55,660 --> 00:23:02,640
group of people that came to that conclusion of applying computational signal analysis to

281
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:08,420
investing? Well, it's effectively the same thing as code breaking. You are looking for signal in

282
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:14,060
the noise and trying to use computers and algorithms to mine signal from something that

283
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:19,800
otherwise kind of looks random. Totally. When Jim started working on code breaking, I think he just

284
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:24,500
looked right back to his experience trading in the markets and was like, whoa, this is the same thing.

285
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:30,000
Which is not an insight other people had. That was the amazing thing about his background,

286
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:35,180
priming him to realize that. Yes. There's all this noise in this data,

287
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,800
and it is impossible for a human to sit here and look at this data and say,

288
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:43,900
oh, I know what the Soviets are saying. No, no, you have to use mathematical models and

289
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:49,500
statistical analysis to extract the patterns. So mathematical models, statistical analysis,

290
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:56,260
we actually hear a lot of that in the world today because machine learning is a thing.

291
00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:04,760
Yes. What they are really doing here at IDA and then soon in Rentech is early machine learning.

292
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:11,600
And Jim just had this incredibly brilliant insight that you can use these techniques and

293
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:16,880
this technology for making investments, which makes this the perfect time to talk about our

294
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,620
presenting sponsor for this season, JP Morgan Payments.

295
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:25,340
Yes. The finance industry has a rich history of innovating, dating all the way back to the

296
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:31,180
literal renaissance, where double-entry bookkeeping and letters of credit revolutionized global trade

297
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:36,320
and economic development. And JP Morgan Payments really continues that tradition in their technology

298
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:42,660
investments today. They move $10 trillion a day securely. That is a quarter of all U.S.

299
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:48,780
dollar flows globally. Just think about the sheer volume of data at 5,000 transactions per second

300
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:49,080
and how important it is to us. And that's what we're doing here at IDA.

301
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:49,100
And that's what we're doing here at IDA. And that's what we're doing here at IDA.

302
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:49,200
And that's what we're doing here at IDA. And that's what we're doing here at IDA.

303
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:49,260
And that's what we're doing here at IDA. And that's what we're doing here at IDA.

304
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,260
And how important that is to the global economy.

305
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,020
Unsurprisingly, JP Morgan Payments has been in the AI game for years now.

306
00:24:56,420 --> 00:25:00,400
Similar to Rentech, they were also early to recognize the value of AI to gather,

307
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:05,400
process, and analyze those massive troves of data to provide solutions for their customers

308
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:09,800
and mitigate risk, like when they incorporated AI into their cash flow forecasting tool,

309
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:14,500
which helps businesses manage liquidity. And that proved especially valuable during the pandemic.

310
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:19,200
Yep. So also, unsurprisingly, JP Morgan was ranked number one in a recent global

311
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,860
banking index of AI capabilities, with Fortune saying they were, quote,

312
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:27,920
head and shoulders above the others. Their customers get AI-powered payment solutions

313
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:33,220
for fraud prevention, customer insights, and treasury insights, all of which grows the bottom

314
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:38,840
line. They can even analyze transaction data to predict and mitigate fraud patterns in real time

315
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:43,860
with their validation services, helping stop millions of dollars for customers in attempted

316
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:48,780
fraud. Yep. We were doing some research to prep for this segment, and we came across something

317
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:55,740
pretty wild. The United States Treasury Department has started using AI to detect suspected check fraud

318
00:25:55,740 --> 00:26:03,200
and recovered over $375 million in 2023 utilizing the new tools. The U.S. Treasury Department

319
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:08,380
disperses trillions of dollars annually, so if they continue to employ new technologies like this,

320
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,120
it could really add up to the tune of billions. So how does this fit in? Well,

321
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:18,680
the Treasury Department recently selected JP Morgan to provide account validation services

322
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:24,240
for federal agencies. Obviously, payment integrity and this issue of improper payments is top of mind

323
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:30,140
for them, and at enormous scale. So whether you are one of the largest institutions in the world

324
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:35,680
or a small business like us here at Acquired, JP Morgan offers you peace of mind and protection.

325
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:40,480
Yeah. One more playbook theme in common between Rentech and JP Morgan Payments,

326
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:45,480
they both analyze data to uncover patterns and insights you may never think to look for.

327
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,700
One of their clients, a furniture store,

328
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:53,940
has a correlation with customers who also shop at pet stores where shoppers spent 76%

329
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:59,120
more than the average customer when this was the case. So the furniture store launched a line of

330
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:03,320
pet-friendly furnishings for that audience. These are the sorts of insights that drive

331
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:07,760
growth with JP Morgan Payments as your partner. When it comes to payments technology, businesses

332
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:12,800
of all sizes can benefit from having end-to-end AI-powered solutions that are constantly learning.

333
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:17,600
And JP Morgan's API-first infrastructure across all aspects of treasury and payments

334
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,760
is a one-stop shop.

it is Fraud Prevention Month. So listeners can learn even more by following JP Morgan on LinkedIn.

337
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:36,600
Okay, David, so this paper is published. They're going to trade and make a whole bunch of money

338
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:42,880
in the stock market by applying this code-breaking signal processing data analysis approach to

339
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,600
investing.

340
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:48,240
Yep. So then the natural question is, okay, what is the model here?

341
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,880
How are they going to do this? And it turns out that one of the employees of IDA at this time,

342
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,120
and one of the members of this sort of rebel group, shall we say, within the organization

343
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:05,540
is a guy named Lenny Baum. And Lenny just happens to be the world expert in a mathematical concept

344
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:12,640
called a Markov model, specifically a version of the Markov model called a hidden Markov model.

345
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:18,140
Now, a Markov model is a statistical concept that's used,

346
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:25,820
to model pseudo-random or chaotic situations. Basically, it says, let's abandon any attempt

347
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:33,020
to actually understand what is going on in all of this data that we have, and instead just focus on

348
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:39,940
what are the observable states that we can see of the situation? Can we identify different states

349
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:47,560
that the situation is in? And if we just do that, can we predict future states based on what we've

350
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,220
observed about the situation? And if we just do that, can we predict future states based on what we've observed about the situation?

351
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:54,600
patterns of past states? And the answer to that is usually yes, even if you don't know anything

352
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:59,520
about fundamentally how the system operates. So the great example that Greg Zuckerman gives

353
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:06,660
in the book is, yes, a baseball game. There's three balls and two strikes. That state has a

354
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:11,840
narrow set of states after it. It's going to be a strikeout. They're going to get on base. It's

355
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:16,360
going to be a walk, or maybe they foul it off and it keeps going. There's only really a narrow set

356
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,220
of things that could happen after that. Whereas, if you're going to do a strikeout, you're going to

357
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,940
when it's zero balls and zero strikes, there's a lot that could happen. They could just keep

358
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:26,020
pitching. And if you don't know the rules, you're like, why do they just keep pitching?

359
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:30,100
And so it's this sort of great way to explain this idea of the black box that

360
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:36,180
if nobody tells you the rules to the game by observing the outputs enough and observing,

361
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:44,340
okay, in this state, these outputs are possible, you actually can kind of get pretty good at at

362
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:47,960
least, if not predicting, understanding the probability distribution,

363
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,240
of the outcomes for any given state in the game.

364
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:59,380
So we brought up machine learning and AI a minute ago. This is a foundational concept to modern day

365
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:04,500
AI. If you think about large language models and predicting what comes next, it's not like these

366
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:10,760
large language models necessarily understand English. They're just really, really good at

367
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:16,580
predicting states and the next state, i.e. characters and the next character or pixels and

368
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:18,220
the next set of pixels or frame.

369
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:23,880
And obviously, they're much fancier than that. But that is kind of the underpinning of it all. I

370
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:28,440
mean, I remember in my sophomore year of college computer science class, I had a Markov chain

371
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:33,660
assignment. And it was basically write a Java program to ingest this public domain book. And

372
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:38,140
then I would give it a seed word, you know, the first word of each sentence and press return,

373
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:42,780
return, return, return, return. And it would scan through the probability tree and give me the most

374
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:47,900
probable word based on the corpus of the book that it just read to create some sentence. And it feels

375
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:51,940
like magic. And of course, in these early rudimentary Markov chain things like the one I did in

376
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:58,220
college, it kind of spits out nonsense. But that would evolve to be the LLMs that we know of today.

377
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:04,180
Yes, totally. And that is what they were using at IDA to do code breaking. And that's what they

378
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:08,200
propose in this paper that they could use in the stock market too.

379
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:15,700
Exactly. And the way that this applies to investing is just like you might not know the rules of

380
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,880
baseball, but if you've watched enough of it, you know, you're going to know the rules of baseball.

381
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:23,920
You can kind of guess at what the probabilities of the next thing to happen are based on the state.

382
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:28,020
Investing is kind of the same thing, or at least the stock market movements are where

383
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:31,340
you don't know the future. You don't know what's going to happen. You don't know if

384
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:36,900
stock X affects stock Y in some way, because you don't know in what way those companies do

385
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:42,020
business together or who holds both stocks. Are they overlapping investors? Like you don't know

386
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:47,560
the relationship between those companies. So you can't forecast with 100% certainty what is going

387
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:47,880
to happen. And so you can't forecast with 100% certainty what is going to happen. And so you can

388
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:53,440
However, if you suck in enough data about what has happened in the past and the probability

389
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:58,340
distribution from every given state in the past, you probably could make some educated guesses

390
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:04,500
or at least understand the probability of any individual outcome based on a state today of

391
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:12,400
what could happen next. Yes, exactly. So Jim and Lenny and this whole little crew,

392
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:17,180
they're pretty fired up. They're like, oh, great. Let's go.

393
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:23,120
Let's go raise a fund and invest in the markets using this strategy.

394
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,840
Certainly, we're going to be successful at raising that fund. And certainly,

395
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:28,160
we're going to be very profitable because we've got this great idea.

396
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:35,740
Totally. What could go wrong? Well, in the mid-60s, the idea that some wonky academics

397
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:44,200
at some random secretive agency in Princeton, New Jersey could go raise money was non-viable.

398
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,160
I mean, it was hard enough for Warren Buffett to,

399
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:53,140
at this point in time, for his fund. And he was Benjamin Graham's anointed appointed disciple.

400
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:59,540
And here are these academics who are working at some random unknown non-profit saying,

401
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,720
give us money. We don't know anything about these companies that we're going to invest in.

402
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:07,420
We don't know anything about fundamentals, but we've got a really good algorithm.

403
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:11,960
People are probably like, what is an algorithm? So they just have no access to capital.

404
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:17,000
Right. This was decades before it became high pedigree to come from a

405
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,060
technical computer science background in the world of investing.

406
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:27,160
Yes. So a bunch of kind of Keystone Cops style fundraising happens here. They're going around

407
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:31,100
in secret. They're trying to keep the IDA bosses from knowing what they're doing.

408
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:37,560
One of the group ends up leaving a copy of the investment prospectus on the copy machine

409
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:43,500
at work one night, and the boss discovers it and calls them all into his office and is like,

410
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:46,820
guys, what are you doing here? Right. It's a little bit of a clown show on the

411
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:53,000
operational side, even if the idea is good. Yes. So they end up abandoning the effort,

412
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:57,440
both because they can't raise money and because IDA has found out about this and they're not too

413
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:03,680
pleased. Shortly after all of this, though, Jim ends up moving on anyway, because the Vietnam

414
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:09,400
War starts. And he, as you can imagine from his background, is not a supporter of the Vietnam

415
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:16,500
War at this point in time. Jim writes an op-ed in the New York Times denouncing the Vietnam

416
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:20,540
War and saying like, yeah, he's, you know, sort of part of the Defense Department, but like not

417
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:25,540
everybody in the Defense Department is for the war. Which is so naive, thinking you can write

418
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:31,420
an op-ed in the New York freaking Times and that's not going to create issues for you in your job.

419
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:37,340
Even more than that, amazingly, nobody really paid attention to it except a reporter at Newsweek

420
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:43,280
who then comes to interview Jim and ask him some more questions. And he just doubles down on this.

421
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,480
And when the Newsweek piece comes out,

422
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,340
that's when the

423
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:48,940
Department of Defense is like, all right, you got to fire this guy.

424
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:58,400
Yeah. So Jim gets fired in 1967. Even though he's a star codebreaker, he made supposedly huge

425
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:03,700
contributions to the group, which are still classified. But at age 30, with a wife and

426
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:09,960
three kids, he's out on the street. And even though he's super smart, his colleagues love him

427
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:15,880
clearly. He's now bounced out of MIT. He's bounced out of Harvard. He's gone to

428
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:16,320
the University of New York. He's gone to the University of New York. He's gone to the

429
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:16,500
University of New York. He's gone to the University of New York. He's gone to the

430
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:21,780
This seemingly final home for him, great place at IDA. He gets bounced out of there, too.

431
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:31,300
His job prospects are not great. Yeah. So he takes pretty much the only halfway decent paying job

432
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:37,560
that he could get, which is to be the chair of the newly established or maybe reestablished

433
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:45,540
math department at the State University of New York Stony Brook, which is the Long Island campus

434
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:45,700
of the State University of New York. And he's got a job there. He's got a job there. He's got a job there.

435
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:46,320
He's got a job there. He's got a job there. He's got a job there. He's got a job there. He's got a job there.

436
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:55,880
University of New York. This is not Harvard. This is not MIT. No, it is not. But it did have one

437
00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:01,000
very important thing going for it, which is why Jim ended up there. And that is that Nelson

438
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:06,920
Rockefeller, who was then the governor of New York, had launched a campaign, a hundred million

439
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:15,080
dollar campaign to try and turn this Long Island campus of the State University of New York into a

440
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:21,960
mathematical powerhouse, to become the Berkeley of the East. I sort of thought MIT was the Berkeley

441
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:28,740
of the East already, but Rockefeller is waging a campaign that he wants Stony Brook to become

442
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:36,820
a math and sciences powerhouse. And Jim is the key. He wouldn't be able to recruit somebody like Jim

443
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:43,520
otherwise, but because he's now kind of tarnished his career, here's a very talented mathematician

444
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,060
that they can convince to come back. And he's got a job there. And he's got a job there. And he's

445
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:51,320
going to be chair of the department. Yep. So they basically give Jim an unlimited budget and leeway

446
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:57,920
to go try and poach math professors from departments all over the country in the world and bring them

447
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:03,600
there to Long Island. And part of how Jim goes and recruits folks is money, like the old, hey,

448
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:11,480
I'll double your salary line. But the other part of it too, is he's given such leeway and Stony

449
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:15,060
Brook is so different from the politics of an MIT or a university. And he's given such leeway to

450
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:20,060
Harvard or Princeton. He says, hey, come here, I'll pay you more. But even more importantly,

451
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:25,540
you can just focus on your research. You're not going to have to deal with committees. You're

452
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:29,500
not going to have to do all this stuff. There is none of this stuff here. You might have to teach

453
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:33,800
a little bit, but that's not even the point. Rockefeller doesn't want this necessarily become

454
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:39,180
a great teaching institution. He just wants to assemble talent there. Yep. And amazingly,

455
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:44,540
it works. Jim starts getting a bunch of great talent, including James Axe, who is a superstar

456
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:51,640
at number theory from Cornell. And he ends up at Stony Brook recruiting and building

457
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:55,180
one of the best math departments in the world. Amazing.

458
00:37:55,960 --> 00:38:02,040
Totally amazing. But in true Jim fashion, after a couple of years of this and also his marriage

459
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:07,580
with Barbara falling apart, he starts getting restless again. He decides that he wants to go

460
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:12,560
on a sabbatical and go back to Berkeley and reunite with his old advisor there and go

461
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,360
spend some time out on the coast in California.

462
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:19,160
Yeah. And this is where Chern and Simons end up collaborating and developing the Chern-Simons

463
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:23,920
theory that ends up winning the highest award in geometry from the American Mathematical Society

464
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:32,760
and really kind of is Jim's personal mark on mathematics. Yep. Now also, right around the

465
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:40,900
same time, remember the Columbian Flooring Company? It gets acquired and Jim and his buddies who are

466
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:47,540
partners in it come into a good amount of money. And Jim is newly divorced. He's restless in

467
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:55,900
academia. He has these ideas back from when he was at IDA about what you could do in the markets

468
00:38:55,900 --> 00:39:03,260
if you had capital. He starts trading again and he gets more and more into it. Meanwhile, like we

469
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:09,260
said, he's becoming disillusioned again and restless at academia. And in 1978, he leaves

470
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,880
to focus full-time on mathematics. And he's like, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't

471
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:15,360
know. I'm on trading, which is a huge shock to the academic community. Remember, he's assembled

472
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:20,140
this superstar team there at Stony Brook. There's a quote in Greg's book from another mathematician

473
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:25,420
at Cornell. We looked down on him when he did this, like he had been corrupted and had sold

474
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:30,980
his soul to the devil. Yeah. I mean, it was really viewed in the math community as anyone who's going

475
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:36,000
to do investing is throwing away their talent. And it wasn't even that it was common the way

476
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,500
that it sort of is today. Right. Jim was the first one. But the idea that you would leave to do

477
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:40,860
anything.

478
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:48,380
Commercial. You're doing a disservice to humanity. Yes, exactly. And leaving to do anything. Sure. But

479
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:53,280
leaving to do investing was almost just seen as dirty. Like it's this rich person's game that

480
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:59,200
provides no value to society. Right. Yeah. I don't think it was that the rest of the math world was

481
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:03,220
skeptical that it could work. They probably were like, oh, yeah, this could work. But they were

482
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:09,660
like, ew. Academics tend to be much more motivated by prestige than money. So I could totally see

483
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:13,320
this other people being like, oh, I could do that if I wanted. But I have this higher calling and

484
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:17,840
everyone respects me for this higher calling. And my currency is the papers I publish and the awards

485
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:22,680
that I win. And that's what I want. Yep. Now, Stony Brook, we should say, too, like it's a very nice

486
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:28,460
place. Yes. But it's in the middle of Long Island on the North Shore. This is not the Hamptons.

487
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:34,540
It's like the Long Island suburbs. Yep. The wooded Long Island suburbs. Yes. The wooded

488
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:38,940
Long Island suburbs. Here's Jim in a strip mall next to a pizza joint,

489
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:44,380
setting up his trading operation that he decides very cleverly to call monometrics,

490
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:53,820
a combination of money and metrics or econometrics. And he recruits his old IDA buddy,

491
00:40:54,540 --> 00:41:03,660
original partner in crime on the trading idea, Lenny Baum, to come and join him. And this time,

492
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:08,540
though, they have some capital from the sale of the flooring company. And how much did he make on

493
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:16,600
sale? I think together with Jim, his partners and whatever money Lenny put in, they had a little

494
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:24,220
less than four million dollars in this initial capital in 1978. Yep. Now, Jim also has another

495
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:29,980
advantage at this point in time, which is he's right down the street from Stony Brook and he's

496
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:36,660
just recruited all of these superstar mathematicians. The table has been set. Yes. And those

497
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,880
folks are more loyal to Jim than they are.

498
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:45,260
But they're more loyal right now to academia than they are to finance. This is not a paved

499
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:50,540
pathway until Jim paves this pathway. Yes, in general, but some of them, and in particular,

500
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:58,060
the superstar James Axe, Jim convinces to come join him in his trading operations.

501
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:06,340
So having Baum and Axe and Simons, it's like suddenly this extremely credible team in the

502
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:07,900
world. Yes.

503
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:13,140
Uncredible. Right. All the theorems that a lot of mathematicians are using every day

504
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:16,580
are all named after these three guys who are now at the same firm trading.

505
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:23,540
Yes. And it's led by Jim, who's somebody that they respect as an academic, but even more important

506
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:28,800
is somebody they want to work for and they look up to and they think is cool. And he's out there

507
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:35,520
being like, hey, I think we can make money. Right. Now, at this point, they're primarily

508
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,440
trading currencies, not stocks.

509
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:45,500
And currencies are obviously large markets, but they aren't impacted by as many signals and as

510
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:51,560
many factors as stocks are, or really even slightly more complex commodities like, I don't

511
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:56,080
know, soybeans or whatever. And it seemed to me like a lot of the trading of currencies they were

512
00:42:56,080 --> 00:43:02,540
doing was basically based on feelings that they had around how a central bank was acting. Like

513
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:06,380
if the head of state of a certain country was going to do something or not, it's basically like

514
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:08,860
betting on how one single currency is going to do something or not. And it's basically like

515
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:15,680
who was in control of currencies at governments would act. So to your point about very few signals

516
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:19,480
impacting price, it's knowing what one person is going to do.

517
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:25,020
Yes. And this is super important. At the end of the day, they build some models there. They're

518
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:32,820
getting the early versions and infrastructure and scaffolding of this quantitative approach set up.

519
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:37,820
But in terms of the actual trades they're putting on, they're still doing all of it by hand.

520
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:38,320
And they're still doing it by hand.

521
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:38,860
And they're still doing it by hand.

522
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:45,220
They're still all really going on a fundamental type analysis. They'll take some signals from

523
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:48,940
the model. They'll see it's interesting what they spit out, but they're not going to act on

524
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:55,000
anything unless they can be like, oh yeah, I see what is going on here. I have a hypothesis.

525
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:58,980
Right. The computers are by no means running loose at this point.

526
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:04,880
By no means at all. Yeah. They're just suggesting patterns and ideas. And Jim and Lenny and James,

527
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:08,440
they have to then decide, hey, are we going to do this or not? Or are we going to do something

528
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:11,000
just totally different that we think is what's going to happen?

529
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:11,480
Yep.

530
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:20,180
And this actually does make sense, really for two reasons. One, computers and computing power just

531
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:29,220
wasn't sophisticated enough yet to really build AI in a way that's powerful enough that it could

532
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:35,300
work well enough you could really trust it. That's one part. The other part is these folks

533
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:38,260
are mathematicians. They're not computer scientists.

534
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:39,040
Right.

535
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:47,020
And they're really, really good at building models, decoding signals, obviously, but they're

536
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:52,640
much more from this realm of theory. And I actually spoke with Howard Morgan, who's going to come up

537
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:57,140
here in a second, and he made this point to me. He's like, in math, there's this concept of

538
00:44:57,140 --> 00:45:02,620
traceability that's a really, really important cultural tenet. It's like proving a proof or

539
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:08,420
proving a theorem or something like that. You really need to understand what's going on. And

540
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:13,220
why to get ahead in the field. It's not like you can just say, oh, hey, the data suggests this. It's

541
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:17,260
like, no, no, no, you need proof. And that's the world that these guys are coming from. They're

542
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:22,880
like, oh, we can use data to sort of help us here. But ultimately, we want to have a rock solid

543
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:28,320
theory of what is fundamentally happening here. Fascinating, which is very different than we'll

544
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:32,060
cram a huge amount of data in and then whatever the data suggests, we know it's true because the

545
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:37,160
data suggests it, which is sort of where they would end up many years later once they had both

546
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:38,400
the hardware you're referring to.

547
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:43,160
Sophisticated computers, the clean data that would be required to make all of those

548
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:49,560
incredibly numerous and fast calculations, and also the real computer engineering architecture

549
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:55,880
to build these scale systems to actually act on large amounts of signals and understand them all

550
00:45:55,880 --> 00:46:00,880
to come up with results. They just didn't have any of that at the time. So it was hunches and

551
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:08,160
chalkboards. Yes. And so much so that even Jim is ringleader here. He's far from convinced that he

552
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:11,880
should put all of his wealth into this thing. He's like, oh, yeah, this is interesting. We're

553
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:17,260
building. We're experimenting like great. But I also want to put my money somewhere else, too,

554
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:23,020
for some diversification. So this is where Howard Morgan comes in. You know, we used to talk about

555
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:27,840
this on old acquired episodes that in the early days of Silicon Valley, there were only 10 people

556
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:31,280
out here and they all knew each other and they were all doing the same thing.

557
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:37,920
This was also the case in East Coast finance and technology and early VC in these days.

558
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:41,800
Howard Morgan would go on to be one of the co-founders of First Round Capital.

559
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:47,060
Which was essentially spun out of Renaissance. Like it was kind of the venture capital

560
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:51,220
work that they were doing at Renaissance that didn't fit with the rest of Renaissance.

561
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:56,260
Yes. So here's how it all went down. And this is so poorly understood out there.

562
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:02,920
Yes. Howard was a computer science and business school professor at the University of Pennsylvania.

563
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:07,040
So he taught CS at Penn and business at Wharton.

564
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:14,180
And he had been involved in bringing ARPANET to Penn and was kind of like early, early

565
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:22,500
internet pioneer. And so as a result, he was super plugged into tech and early startups

566
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:29,000
and really early, early proto internet stuff. And Jim gets excited about investing together

567
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:35,320
with Howard. So they say like, hey, maybe we should partner together. And in 1982,

568
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:38,140
Jim actually winds down Monomath. He's like, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't

569
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:45,460
And he and Howard co-found a new firm together that's going to reflect both of their backgrounds

570
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:51,740
and be a great diversification. Jim and his group are going to bring in the quantitative trading

571
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:58,180
thing. And again, trading on currencies and commodities at this point. And Howard's going

572
00:47:58,180 --> 00:48:06,080
to bring in private company technology investing. And they pick a name for a firm that is going to

573
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:06,980
reflect this.

574
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:10,120
It's crazy.

575
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:12,760
And that is why Rentech is called Rentech.

576
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:17,660
I could not, when we figured this out in the research, I could not believe that this is not a

577
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:23,600
more widely understood story, that this is the origins of what is today a fantastic venture

578
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:29,280
capital firm, first round capital. But you could not name two more different strategies

579
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:36,140
in investing. I mean, a long-term illiquid thing like venture capital, highly speculative

580
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:38,120
versus, you know, we're going to do this. We're going to do this. We're going to do this. We're

581
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:43,160
going to trade whether we think the French franc is going to go up or down tomorrow based on the

582
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:47,220
whim of some government leader. It's unbelievable these were under the same roof.

583
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:51,160
Totally. But when you know the whole background in history, it kind of makes sense because

584
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:57,540
this is their personal money. This is Jim and his buddies and Lenny and James and Howard.

585
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:02,120
There's not institutional capital here. They're not out pitching LPs of like,

586
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:07,440
oh, you should invest in my diversified strategy of currency trading and private technology startups.

587
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:07,640
Yeah.

588
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:10,640
Multi-strategy. This is really multi-strategy.

589
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:16,780
Yeah. We'll get into what multi-strategy today means later. But in these early days of rent tech,

590
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:23,840
50% of the portfolio was venture capital and 50% was currency trading. And in fact,

591
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:30,160
a couple of years after they get started, the currency trading side of the firm almost blows

592
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:36,800
up when Lenny goes super long on government bonds and the market goes against him and the whole

593
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,080
portfolio drops 40%.

594
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:46,900
Which is wild. That ends up triggering a clause in Lenny's agreement with Jim and they sell off

595
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:51,860
Lenny's entire portfolio and he leaves the firm. This is crazy. I mean,

596
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:56,560
blow up risk is always an issue in the markets, but this happened to rent tech.

597
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:00,060
And because we quickly got to this point in the story, it would be easy to say,

598
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:04,760
well, that's a clause that has a lot of teeth. There were many sort of rumbles of something

599
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:08,060
like this potentially happening. Simon's going to Lenny.

600
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:13,660
Hey, maybe we should cut some of our losses and it's okay to trade out of these positions. And

601
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:18,460
Lenny was just very dug in on I'm a true believer. And that's how you can get into a situation where

602
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:24,360
you trigger a covenant like this. Totally. And again, also shows they weren't doing model-based

603
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:30,900
quantitative trading really at this point in time. No, so much gut. So as a result of that,

604
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:37,980
for a while, rent tech is truly almost entirely a venture capital firm. At one point on,

605
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:42,360
the venture side, just one investment, Franklin Dictionaries. Do you remember Ben?

606
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:42,800
Yes.

607
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:45,960
Franklin Electronic Dictionaries. Yeah. That was one of their biggest investments.

608
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:50,000
That one investment is half of Jim's net worth.

609
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:50,800
What?

610
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:53,360
At this low point for the trading side. Yes.

611
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,560
I had no idea. That's crazy.

612
00:50:56,280 --> 00:51:02,260
Yeah. So in the book, Greg talks about, oh, Jim was focused on venture capital and that's kind

613
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:05,500
of the story out there. It's like, well, he was focused on venture capital because that was the

614
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:07,120
only thing working and making money.

615
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:07,740
Yeah.

616
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:12,080
The only thing where they actually had an edge from Howard's access to deal flow,

617
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:14,860
because they certainly didn't have an edge in the global currency markets.

618
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:21,900
So I think perhaps in part because of the trading losses, James Axe starts to get a

619
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:27,400
little disillusioned too. And he tells Jim that he wants to move out to California with Sandor

620
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:31,860
Strauss, who started working with them at this point. Sandor was another Stony Brook alum that

621
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:36,880
joined them. And the two of them want to move out to California and do trading out there.

622
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:38,100
Yeah.

623
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:38,120
Yeah.

624
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:43,800
And Jim says, sir, fine. I'm here with Howard. I'm doing venture capital stuff. Why don't you go

625
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:50,580
move out to California? You can start your own firm, which they do. It's called Axe Com, A-X-C-O-M.

626
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:58,240
And we'll contract with Axe Com to run what's left of the trading operations here for Rentech.

627
00:51:59,060 --> 00:52:04,700
So it's this interesting arm's length thing where Jim strikes a deal where he's going to own a part

628
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:07,980
of Axe Com in exchange for this very favorable deal.

629
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:11,580
Favorable contractual relationship where they're going to hire them to be the manager

630
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:16,920
for this pot of money that Renaissance has raised. But, you know, it's technically not

631
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:18,260
Renaissance. It's Axe Com.

632
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:22,140
Right. It's another company that is now doing the quantitative trading.

633
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:25,000
Yep. And I think Jim owned a quarter of it. Is that right?

634
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:26,140
Yes, that's right.

635
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:31,380
And importantly, I don't think anyone had any idea what Axe Com would become

636
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:35,260
or how unbelievably profitable it would be.

637
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:37,040
Uh, no.

638
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:41,540
Nobody would have done what they did had they known what was coming.

639
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:43,280
Yes. Wouldn't have spun it out.

640
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:52,640
No. So once Axe and Strauss get out to California, Strauss, he's kind of on the computing data

641
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:56,840
infrastructure side. That's what he was doing at Stony Brook. And that's what he came into

642
00:52:56,840 --> 00:53:02,940
Renaissance to build. He starts getting really into data and he starts collecting

643
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:06,080
intraday pricing movements on securities.

644
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:13,920
At this point in time, I think really the best data you could get from providers out there was

645
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:21,340
maybe open and close data on securities pricing. Strauss finds a way to get tick data,

646
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:26,780
like every 20 minute data on these securities throughout the day.

647
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:32,580
Not only that, he's getting historical data that predates what your traditional data providers

648
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:35,880
would give you and then ingesting it into computers.

649
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:40,860
And cleaning the data to get it into the same format as the tick data. So he's getting early

650
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:47,580
1900s, even 1800s stuff to try to just say, at some point, hopefully we'll be able to make use

651
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:52,020
of this. And I want to have this just really, really clean data set about the way that these

652
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:57,520
markets interact. Yeah. I mean, he's doing ETL on the data. Yes. I think before anybody knew

653
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:02,400
what ETL was. Again, no one told him to do that. That was just a self-motivated, almost like

654
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:05,980
obsession of like, well, if we're going to have data, it should be well formatted. And,

655
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:11,100
well understood and labeled and all that. So that's one thing that happens. The other thing

656
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:16,440
is Jim says, oh, you're going out to California. Let me hook you up with my buddy. Who's a Berkeley

657
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:25,060
professor out there, Elwin Burlakamp. And Burlakamp had studied with folks like John Nash

658
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:29,920
and Claude Shannon at MIT. I love that Claude Shannon is coming in again.

659
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:34,560
I know. We talked about it a lot on the Qualcomm episode, father of information theory,

660
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:35,960
really this.

661
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:41,120
Center of gravity for attracting tons of talent to MIT and kind of paving the way for what would

662
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:46,500
become phone technology and telecommunications broadly in the future. But the fact that

663
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:51,180
Burlakamp is crossing paths at MIT with Claude Shannon, so cool.

664
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:58,080
So cool. And most importantly for this specific use case, Burlakamp had worked with John Kelly,

665
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:04,580
who developed the Kelly criterion on bet sizing, which poker players will likely be well familiar

666
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:05,020
with.

667
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:05,560
Yep.

668
00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:10,540
So with this combination now of much, much, much better and deeper data from Strauss

669
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:14,620
and Burlakamp coming in and working with Axe on the models and saying,

670
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:21,100
hey, we should be smart about the bet sizing that we're doing in the trades that are coming out of

671
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:25,140
these models versus I don't know what they were doing before. Maybe it was naive of like every

672
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:30,860
trade was the same or just like we should actually be systematic about this. The models start

673
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:32,200
really working.

674
00:55:32,780 --> 00:55:34,700
Yep. This is the turning point.

675
00:55:35,140 --> 00:55:35,620
Yeah.

676
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:42,720
In these kind of mid-80s years, Axe Com is generating IRRs of like 20 plus percent on the

677
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:48,400
trading side. You know, not necessarily going to beat venture capital IRRs, but liquid.

678
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:48,960
Yes.

679
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:49,640
Reliable.

680
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:54,220
Well, that's the thing. They don't know how reliable yet. They know they've done it kind

681
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:59,160
of a few years in a row here. But the question is how uncorrelated to the stock market over a

682
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:04,980
long period of time and how predictable are these returns or is it just super high variance?

683
00:56:05,140 --> 00:56:05,740
Yes.

684
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:13,560
But the early results are really good. And Jim and Burlakamp especially are very encouraged by

685
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:21,140
this. So in 1988, Jim and Howard Morgan decide to spin out the venture investments and Howard goes

686
00:56:21,140 --> 00:56:29,000
to manage those with basically their own money. Fun coda on this. When Howard starts first round

687
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:33,580
a number of years later with Josh Koppelman, Jim, of course, is a large LP.

688
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:33,960
Ah.

689
00:56:34,860 --> 00:56:35,840
And Howard, of course, is a large LP.

690
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:44,700
Howard, of course, remains an investor in Rentech. The first institutional fund that

691
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:53,080
first round ended up raising was a 50X on $125 million fund. It had Roblox, Uber, and Square.

692
00:56:53,900 --> 00:57:00,280
So I believe this is right. I think Jim made as much money from his investments in first round

693
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:04,100
as Howard did from his LP stake in Rentech.

694
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:05,680
That's wild.

695
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:07,000
Isn't that amazing?

696
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:13,720
Wow. That is a untold story about Jim Simons. I think I read basically every primary source

697
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:18,700
thing on Jim or Renaissance on the whole internet, but I assume you got that from Howard.

698
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:23,120
Yeah. It was super fun talking to Howard about this and just the history of how first round

699
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:27,360
started and early super angel investing and everything that became.

700
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:33,220
I also didn't realize that first rounds fund one was a 50X on $125 million fund.

701
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:35,660
First institutional fund?

702
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:37,680
Which I believe they called fund two.

703
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:40,900
I mean, wild, wild stuff.

704
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:50,340
Totally wild. So when Howard spins out the venture activities, Jim then decides to set up a new

705
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:57,660
fund as a joint venture between Rentech and Axcom. And they decide to name it after all of the

706
00:57:57,660 --> 00:58:04,720
collective mathematical awards that Jim and James and Burlakamp and all these prestigious mathematicians

707
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:05,700
have won.

708
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:09,840
in their careers. They name it the Medallion Fund.

709
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:11,020
Ba-da-da.

710
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:12,160
Ba-da-da.

711
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:16,920
And listeners, we've arrived. This is the part of the story that matters. The Medallion Fund

712
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:23,320
is the crown jewel, or you might even say actually the only interesting thing about Renaissance. And

713
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:28,740
it is born out of this observation that, oh my God, what they're doing over there at Axcom is

714
00:58:28,740 --> 00:58:34,020
really interesting. Maybe they shouldn't be doing it all the way over there. Maybe that should be a

715
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:35,680
deeper part of the fold here at Rentech.

716
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:41,520
And we shouldn't have let that get away or frankly given up on the quantitative trading strategies too early.

717
00:58:41,520 --> 00:59:04,440
And again, still just currencies, still just commodities futures, not playing the stock market at all, but the seeds and the ideas, the huge amount of clean data, the robust engineering infrastructure to process all that data, the mining of signals from data to figure out what trading strategies to execute, that is really starting to form here in this moment.

718
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:05,120
in this moment.

719
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:05,620
in this moment.

720
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:07,860
This new joint venture, this Medallion Fund.

721
00:59:08,020 --> 00:59:17,240
Those ideas had all existed before. This is the first time that it's all brought together and actually working and operationalized.

722
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:21,760
And frankly, that computers got good enough to actually do it too. That's another big piece of this.

723
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:29,300
Yeah, I don't know that Strauss could have done his data engineering too much earlier in time.

724
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:29,840
Yeah.

725
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:35,380
But before we get into the just absolutely insane run that this

726
00:59:35,620 --> 00:59:43,620
Medallion Fund is about to go on, that continues right through to this day, now is the perfect time for another story about ServiceNow.

727
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:48,680
ServiceNow is one of our big partners here in Season 14 and is just an incredible company.

728
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:49,240
Yep.

729
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:58,780
ServiceNow digitally transforms your enterprise, helping automate processes, improve service delivery, and increase operational efficiency all in one intelligent platform.

730
00:59:59,140 --> 01:00:05,600
Over 85% of the Fortune 500 runs on them, and they have quickly joined the Microsofts and the NVIDIAs as one of the most powerful companies in the world.

731
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:18,600
So we talked on our Novo Nordisk episode about how ServiceNow founder Fred Luddy discovered this core insight that software can transform and eliminate manual tasks.

732
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:29,100
And on Hermes, we told the story of how current CEO Bill McDermott came in and turbocharged that into an absolute monster $150 billion market cap global behemoth.

733
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:35,560
The key thread that connects those two eras is that from day one, Fred knew the ServiceNow platform.

734
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:37,780
could be used across the whole enterprise.

735
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:47,280
But at the same time, he also knew from his decades of prior software experience that launching a broad, horizontal offering right out of the gate as a startup was a recipe for failure.

736
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:50,200
You need to start with a specific vertical use case.

737
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:53,140
And in this case, he chose IT service management.

738
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:53,780
Yep.

739
01:00:53,860 --> 01:00:55,680
And that's been true for us here on Acquired, too.

740
01:00:55,800 --> 01:01:04,460
David, if we didn't name it Acquired and cover technology acquisitions that actually went well, we never could have broadened and become the podcast that tells the stories of great companies.

741
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:05,500
You can't just start.

742
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:05,940
You can't just pass that.

743
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:06,660
Totally.

744
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:10,480
Well, this is what's so cool and where I think the playbook lesson really is for listeners.

745
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:14,540
Because you can't just pick any use case, you have to be strategic about it.

746
01:01:14,540 --> 01:01:21,120
And IT was the perfect vertical because every other department has to interface with them from the CEO on down.

747
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:24,840
So they're going to notice when IT service management rapidly improves.

748
01:01:25,060 --> 01:01:29,940
All of those support tickets that used to take forever are now just magically resolved.

749
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:35,580
And that greases the wheels for the other departments to say, hey, maybe we should adopt ServiceNow to turbocharge.

750
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:38,220
And digitally transform our service levels, too.

751
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:38,900
Yep.

752
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:46,100
Once those other departments do pull the trigger on joining the ServiceNow platform, who is in charge of rolling it out for them?

753
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:51,180
Of course, it's IT, who are already true ServiceNow believers.

754
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:55,980
I'm honestly not sure that there's a better enterprise software playbook in history than ServiceNow's.

755
01:01:56,560 --> 01:02:02,680
So once they established the beachhead in IT, they then took the same platform to HR with employee experience.

756
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:05,500
They took it to CSM with customer service requests.

757
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:09,800
They took it to finance with regulatory reporting, audit, and expense approvals.

758
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:13,100
And now they're adding AI, which will take everything to the next level.

759
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:13,740
Yep.

760
01:02:14,180 --> 01:02:19,780
So if you want to learn more about the ServiceNow platform and playbook and hear how it can transform your business,

761
01:02:20,140 --> 01:02:22,360
head on over to servicenow.com slash acquired.

762
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:25,420
And when you get in touch, just tell them that Ben and David sent you.

763
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:30,840
So they've got this grand new plan and vision with the Medallion Fund.

764
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:34,940
Unfortunately, right out of the gate.

765
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:37,340
The fund stumbles a bit.

766
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:40,880
And Axe ends up getting burned out.

767
01:02:41,780 --> 01:02:43,560
Burlakamp, though, is like, no, no, no, no.

768
01:02:43,780 --> 01:02:44,760
This is an anomaly.

769
01:02:44,980 --> 01:02:46,160
Like, we're going to fix this.

770
01:02:46,420 --> 01:02:51,760
I really, really believe that what we're doing with these models is going to be extremely profitable.

771
01:02:52,280 --> 01:02:58,000
So he buys out most of Axe's stake in the summer of 1989.

772
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:01,660
And he moves the offices up to Berkeley.

773
01:03:01,940 --> 01:03:05,580
And there he comes up with the idea that,

774
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:11,180
hey, we should trade more frequently, a lot more frequently.

775
01:03:11,620 --> 01:03:15,720
Because if what we're trying to do is understand the state of the market from the data we have

776
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:17,540
and then predict the future state of the market,

777
01:03:17,540 --> 01:03:21,760
and then combine that with figuring out the right bet sizing to make,

778
01:03:22,220 --> 01:03:26,460
we actually want to make a lot more trades to get a lot more data points

779
01:03:26,460 --> 01:03:31,080
and learn a lot more about the bets we're making so that we can then size them up or size them down.

780
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:33,660
It's that and it's two other things.

781
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:34,660
One is the further...

782
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:39,100
The further into the future you look, the less certain you can be about it.

783
01:03:39,340 --> 01:03:42,080
If you know something is worth $10 right now,

784
01:03:42,460 --> 01:03:45,380
what you know five minutes from now is it's probably going to be worth about $10.

785
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:49,440
The most likely situation is it's within 5% of that.

786
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:53,420
If you ask me three years from now, I have almost no intuition about that.

787
01:03:53,740 --> 01:03:55,740
And a state machine is the same way.

788
01:03:55,900 --> 01:03:57,920
If you flash forward a whole bunch of states,

789
01:03:57,980 --> 01:04:01,800
you sort of lose predictability as you sort of continue down that chain.

790
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:05,140
The second thing is, if your models are showing that,

791
01:04:05,140 --> 01:04:09,560
you're going to be right, call it something like 50.25% of the time,

792
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:17,880
then the amount of money you can make is gated by the number of bets you can make at a quarter percent edge.

793
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:23,080
If I walk up to the casino and I think I'm right about this particular roulette wheel,

794
01:04:23,180 --> 01:04:25,580
which of course you're not, 50.25% of the time,

795
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:28,680
and I decide to play once or play twice or play five times,

796
01:04:29,180 --> 01:04:30,820
there's a chance I could lose all my money.

797
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:34,620
Or if I have tiny little bet sizes, then I'm just not going to make that much money.

798
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:34,680
Right?

799
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:34,700
Right?

800
01:04:34,700 --> 01:04:34,720
Right?

801
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:34,740
Right?

802
01:04:34,740 --> 01:04:34,760
Right?

803
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:34,780
Right?

804
01:04:34,780 --> 01:04:34,840
Right?

805
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:34,860
Right?

806
01:04:34,860 --> 01:04:34,880
Right?

807
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:34,900
Right?

808
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:34,920
Right?

809
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:34,980
Right?

810
01:04:34,980 --> 01:04:35,120
Right?

811
01:04:35,140 --> 01:04:40,640
If I walk up to said game with a little bit of edge and I use small bet sizes and I play 10,000 times,

812
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:42,380
I'm going to walk out with a lot of money.

813
01:04:42,860 --> 01:04:46,400
There is a great Bob Mercer quote about this later.

814
01:04:46,620 --> 01:04:50,660
He says, we're right 50.75% of the time.

815
01:04:50,900 --> 01:04:52,440
And I do think he's making up that number.

816
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:53,200
I think it's illustrative.

817
01:04:53,620 --> 01:04:53,940
Right.

818
01:04:54,500 --> 01:05:00,480
But we're 100% right 50.75% of the time.

819
01:05:00,580 --> 01:05:02,660
You can make billions that way.

820
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:03,860
It's so true.

821
01:05:03,860 --> 01:05:05,060
When you have that little,

822
01:05:05,060 --> 01:05:14,760
it's about making sure that you're not betting so much that a few bets that don't break your way can take you down to zero and to make sure you can just play the game a lot.

823
01:05:15,220 --> 01:05:15,500
A lot.

824
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:15,960
Yes.

825
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:21,380
And then back to the Kelly criterion, adjust your bet sizes over time as you're making those bets.

826
01:05:21,940 --> 01:05:22,060
Yeah.

827
01:05:22,580 --> 01:05:24,500
Now, of course, this is all great in the abstract.

828
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:31,980
If it's that you're literally sitting at a casino and you're somehow perfectly making these bets and you're just sitting right there at the table and then you can walk over to the cashier.

829
01:05:32,180 --> 01:05:33,700
It gets a little bit different in the market.

830
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:34,660
For example,

831
01:05:35,060 --> 01:05:44,540
there are real transaction costs, especially at this point in history before some of these more innovative trading business models with pay for order flow and zero transaction fees and all this stuff.

832
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:47,340
There's real transaction costs to putting on these trades.

833
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:50,520
And of course, you're going to move the market when you put on these trades.

834
01:05:51,020 --> 01:05:52,540
Yes, this is slippage.

835
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:55,220
There's all sorts of practical consideration.

836
01:05:55,780 --> 01:05:57,500
You could get front run by other people.

837
01:05:57,960 --> 01:06:00,200
It's not just a computer program that gets executed.

838
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:04,380
You actually have to meet the constraints of the real world when you're deciding.

839
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:04,940
Instead of,

840
01:06:04,940 --> 01:06:07,520
we're going to have a few big bets, we're going to have 100,000 tiny bets.

841
01:06:08,020 --> 01:06:08,520
Yes.

842
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:20,160
And as time goes on and the whole quant industry emerges and becomes much more sophisticated, I think it's particularly the slippage there that becomes the governor on how high velocity you can actually be on this.

843
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:25,660
And the slippage is that once you are at a certain scale, you are going to move the market with your trades.

844
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:34,320
So the deeper you get into the order book, like let's say you want to buy $5 million of something, maybe your first $100,000, you're pretty sure you can get the quoted price.

845
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:40,320
But by your last $100,000 of that $5 million buy, the price might have gotten pretty different already.

846
01:06:40,980 --> 01:06:41,000
Yeah.

847
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:42,980
We're going to come back to this in just a minute.

848
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:51,600
But this certainly for early rent tech and then even now still for all of quantitative finance is a really, really, really important thing.

849
01:06:52,340 --> 01:06:52,520
Yep.

850
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:56,840
And David, in a very crude way, calls back to last episode on Hermes.

851
01:06:57,240 --> 01:07:04,300
The idea that the price would be highest for the family member that is willing to sell now and sort of goes down over time.

852
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:11,440
If the family was going to sell to Bernard Arnault, it would behoove you to be first in the order book, not last in the order book.

853
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:11,860
Yes.

854
01:07:12,620 --> 01:07:19,320
I feel like there's this metal lesson that I've been learning through Acquired and my own personal investing over the past couple of years.

855
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:22,480
Every market is dependent on supply and demand.

856
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:30,040
You can see quoted valuations and quoted price streams, but oftentimes that's like the mistake of just looking at averages.

857
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:31,200
Exactly.

858
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:31,560
Yes.

859
01:07:31,700 --> 01:07:33,700
Looking at the quoted price of an asset.

860
01:07:33,700 --> 01:07:34,880
That is wrong.

861
01:07:35,300 --> 01:07:40,960
You actually should be looking at what is the volume that is willing to buy and what is the volume that is willing to sell.

862
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:45,540
And for all of those buyers and all of those sellers, what are the price at which they are willing to transact?

863
01:07:46,060 --> 01:07:51,060
And the way that tends to manifest on a stock chart is here's the price of a share right now.

864
01:07:51,140 --> 01:07:54,100
But that's not actually what's going on under the surface.

865
01:07:54,300 --> 01:08:00,420
It's a whole bunch of buyers and sellers who have different willingness to pay and have different amounts that they're trying to buy or sell.

866
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:01,080
Yes.

867
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:03,420
Now, at this point in time, when the Medallion Fund...

868
01:08:03,700 --> 01:08:11,780
When the Medallion Fund is first starting to work in, say, late 1989, early 1990, it's small enough that this isn't a big consideration yet.

869
01:08:11,940 --> 01:08:12,160
Yeah.

870
01:08:12,580 --> 01:08:12,840
Right.

871
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:18,400
Medallion was about $27 million under management when Burleigh Camp bought out Axe.

872
01:08:18,940 --> 01:08:32,180
In 1990, the first full year after that, the fund gains 77.8% gross, which after fees and carry was 55% net.

873
01:08:32,620 --> 01:08:33,680
Now, what were the fees?

874
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:38,540
I mean, either one of those numbers is shooting the freaking lights out.

875
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:46,400
Assuming that this is not a crazy high-risk strategy that they executed and it'll completely fall apart under different market conditions.

876
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:52,460
Like, if this is an actual repeatable strategy that produces the numbers you just said, unbelievable.

877
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:53,820
World-changing.

878
01:08:54,580 --> 01:08:55,000
Hell yeah.

879
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:56,300
Let's go.

880
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:56,780
Yes.

881
01:08:57,340 --> 01:09:00,980
And indeed, it was a hell yeah, let's go situation.

882
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:03,640
So, the numbers you quoted me, the gross and the net.

883
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:04,520
It sounded quite different.

884
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:05,920
Talk to me about the fees and carry.

885
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:11,480
So, carry, I've seen different sources of whether it was 20% or 25% in the early days.

886
01:09:11,700 --> 01:09:15,940
But the management fee on the fund was 5%, which is crazy.

887
01:09:15,940 --> 01:09:20,620
The top venture capital firms in the world charge a 3% management fee.

888
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:24,120
And even that is like, everybody holds their nose and is like, this is ridiculous.

889
01:09:24,340 --> 01:09:31,960
How on earth were these nobodies charging a 5% management fee out the gate to their investors?

890
01:09:32,580 --> 01:09:33,100
Well.

891
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:34,940
A couple things.

892
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:37,120
One, their investors were not sophisticated.

893
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:39,920
It was mostly their own money and their buddy's money.

894
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:41,300
So, they set that precedent.

895
01:09:41,780 --> 01:09:42,500
They set that precedent.

896
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:46,540
But two, though, they actually needed the money.

897
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:46,900
Yes.

898
01:09:47,060 --> 01:09:52,100
Because Strauss's infrastructure costs were about $800,000 a year.

899
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:58,260
So, they just backed into the management fee based on like, hey, we need $800,000 a year to run the infrastructure.

900
01:09:58,260 --> 01:10:01,200
Plus, we need some money to pay folks and whatnot.

901
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:02,120
Like, great.

902
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:03,520
5% management fee.

903
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:12,660
And so, the pitch they're making to the investor base is like, if you believe that we should be able to massively outperform the market doing quantitative trading, well, we're going to need a lot of fees to do that.

904
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:16,440
And so, the investors basically took the deal, if they thought about it enough.

905
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:17,280
Okay.

906
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:18,100
So, that's the fees.

907
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:25,160
On the performance, that 20% or 25%, it's just not actually that far above market, if it's above market at all.

908
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:30,040
What you're seeing is a high fee, normal-ish performance fee fund at this point in time.

909
01:10:30,460 --> 01:10:30,760
Yes.

910
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:33,640
High management fee, normal-ish carrier performance.

911
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:33,960
That's the performance element.

912
01:10:34,260 --> 01:10:34,460
Yep.

913
01:10:34,900 --> 01:10:46,460
So, at the end of 1990, Simons is so jazzed about what's going on that he tells Burlick Camp, hey, you should move here to Long Island.

914
01:10:46,620 --> 01:10:49,040
Let's re-centralize everything here.

915
01:10:49,420 --> 01:10:51,480
I want to go all in on this.

916
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:55,680
I think with some tweaks, we can be up 80% after fees next year.

917
01:10:56,740 --> 01:10:59,680
Burlick Camp is a little more circumspect.

918
01:11:00,260 --> 01:11:01,620
A, he wants to stay in Berkeley.

919
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:03,620
He doesn't have any desire to move to Long Island.

920
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:13,580
And B, I couldn't tell how much of this is just he's a little more conservative than Jim, or how much of this actually might be his, hey, whole poker bet-sizing thing.

921
01:11:14,140 --> 01:11:19,600
He turns to Jim and he says, well, if you're so optimistic, why don't you buy me out?

922
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:28,280
So, Jim does at 6X the basis that Burlick Camp had paid Axe a year earlier.

923
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,680
On the one hand, making a 6X in one year sounds great.

924
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:32,680
On the other hand…

925
01:11:33,640 --> 01:11:46,620
This is the equivalent of when Don Valentine sold Sequoia's Apple Steak before the IPO to lock in a great gain, but miss out on all the upside to come.

926
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:50,640
David, I think we should throw this out so people understand the volume of this.

927
01:11:51,040 --> 01:12:00,260
They've generated on the order of $60 billion of performance fees for the owners of the fund over their entire lifetime.

928
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:03,600
So, on the one hand, 6X in a year ain't…

929
01:12:03,640 --> 01:12:03,880
Not bad.

930
01:12:03,980 --> 01:12:11,340
On the other hand, you owned a giant part of something that has dividended $60 billion in cash out to its owners.

931
01:12:12,020 --> 01:12:12,300
Oof.

932
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:12,760
Yeah.

933
01:12:13,300 --> 01:12:14,660
That's just on the carry side.

934
01:12:14,820 --> 01:12:17,520
I mean, the owners are the principals.

935
01:12:18,020 --> 01:12:21,220
So, just like dollars out of the firm, it's probably twice that.

936
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:28,720
I would estimate probably $150, $200 billion that have come out of Medallion over the last 35 years.

937
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:33,280
So, Jim buys out Burlick Camp.

938
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:41,120
He rolls everything in the Medallion fund back into Rentech itself, moves everything back to Stony Brook.

939
01:12:41,540 --> 01:12:43,100
Strauss moves to Stony Brook.

940
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:50,500
So, it's now the Jim Simons show in New York with Strauss building the engineering systems and Axe, I think, still had a small stake.

941
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:52,820
Yes, that's right. And Strauss had a stake as well.

942
01:12:53,220 --> 01:13:02,820
So, once Jim takes control and moves everything back, he basically decides that he's going to turn…

943
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:14,960
into an even better, even more idealized version of IDA and the math department at Stony Brook.

944
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:32,260
He's going to make this an academics paradise, where if you are one of the absolute smartest mathematicians or systems engineers in the world, this is where you want to be.

945
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:32,960
So…

946
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:37,720
Of course, he starts raiding the Stony Brook department itself again.

947
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:41,840
And this is when Henry Laufer joins full-time.

948
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:51,140
Laufer had been consulting with Medallion in the early days and working with Burlick Camp as they're doing bet sizing, as they're making more frequent trades.

949
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:56,260
But now, once the whole operation has moved back to Long Island, Laufer's like,

950
01:13:56,340 --> 01:13:58,860
Oh, okay, great. I'll come full-time. I'm here at Stony Brook anyway.

951
01:13:59,220 --> 01:14:01,000
This is way more fun than teaching.

952
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:03,520
And listeners, I imagine this is probably the point where you're starting…

953
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:07,040
to get confused and saying, there are so many people in this story.

954
01:14:07,100 --> 01:14:09,800
I think we're on eight or nine. We just keep introducing more people.

955
01:14:10,380 --> 01:14:13,360
And that is the story of renaissance.

956
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:16,840
It is not this singular, clean narrative.

957
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:25,400
It is a very complex reality of a whole bunch of different people that came in and out at different eras,

958
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:32,840
where the firm was trying different things and eventually became phenomenally successful with a very particular approach.

959
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:36,480
But while they were figuring it out along the way, it took a lot of people.

960
01:14:37,020 --> 01:14:39,720
A lot of people and just a lot of time, too.

961
01:14:39,980 --> 01:14:52,780
This is 25 years. This is a quarter century from the time that Baum and Simons write the paper at IDA until Medallion really starts to work.

962
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:54,760
It takes a long time.

963
01:14:54,940 --> 01:15:01,900
And we haven't even introduced the two people who would become the co-CEOs of this company for 20 years.

964
01:15:02,140 --> 01:15:02,620
Yes.

965
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:05,080
Well, let's get to that.

966
01:15:05,720 --> 01:15:12,480
So, Jim moves everything back to Long Island, sets it up as this academic paradise, is recruiting the smartest people in the world.

967
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:24,500
In 1991, the next year, the firm does 54.3% gross returns and 39.4% net returns after fees.

968
01:15:24,620 --> 01:15:28,520
So, not Jim's bogey of 80%, but still pretty freaking great.

969
01:15:28,520 --> 01:15:32,520
And we should say the years of modest performance…

970
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:36,060
From every single year forward, they shoot the lights out.

971
01:15:36,420 --> 01:15:40,460
From 1990 onward, they never lose money.

972
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:45,180
And on a gross basis, they never even do less than 30%.

973
01:15:45,180 --> 01:15:47,540
It's working. It's going.

974
01:15:47,740 --> 01:15:54,220
The whole rest of the story is about hold on, keep the machine working, and we're on the train.

975
01:15:54,940 --> 01:15:57,900
The historic run has begun, let's just say.

976
01:15:58,140 --> 01:15:58,360
Yep.

977
01:15:58,360 --> 01:16:02,360
So, 1992, gross returns are 47%.

978
01:16:03,460 --> 01:16:06,320
93, they're 54%.

979
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:13,960
At the end of 1993, Simons decides to close the fund and not allow new LPs in.

980
01:16:14,240 --> 01:16:18,720
So, if you're an existing LP, you can stay in, but they're no longer open for new inflows.

981
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:28,500
He has so much confidence in what they're doing that he thinks they're all going to make more money without accepting new capital by just keeping it to the existing investor base.

982
01:16:28,940 --> 01:16:32,500
1994, gross returns are 93%.

983
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:34,660
90 freaking percent.

984
01:16:35,460 --> 01:16:39,440
Medallion, at this point, is stacking up cash.

985
01:16:39,900 --> 01:16:42,460
It is a meaningful fund.

986
01:16:42,460 --> 01:16:56,180
It's about $250 million total at this point in time, which is small, but we're talking about 1994 with a bunch of outsiders and academics that have managed to amass a quarter billion dollars here.

987
01:16:56,520 --> 01:16:57,860
People start to pay attention.

988
01:16:58,680 --> 01:17:02,460
And the performance fees on this are $7 million, $13 million.

989
01:17:03,460 --> 01:17:04,500
$52 million.

990
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:09,780
The free cash flow flowing to partners here is certainly becoming real, too.

991
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:10,660
Yes.

992
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:24,100
But as they get into that, call it on the order of magnitude of a billion-dollar scale, they start bumping into the moving markets problem and the slippage that we were talking about earlier.

993
01:17:24,340 --> 01:17:24,460
Yep.

994
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:25,820
And that's sort of in the mid-90s?

995
01:17:26,260 --> 01:17:26,500
Yep.

996
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:29,660
As they're hitting this $250 million, half a billion-dollar scale.

997
01:17:30,040 --> 01:17:30,260
Right.

998
01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:32,820
The computer model spits out, we should go buy.

999
01:17:32,820 --> 01:17:35,460
We should go buy this huge amount of something at this price.

1000
01:17:35,560 --> 01:17:36,200
They go to do it.

1001
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:40,200
They can only buy 10%, 20%, 30% of the amount they want at that price.

1002
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:41,840
And then suddenly, the price is very different.

1003
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:42,580
Yep.

1004
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:52,420
Up to this point, the vast majority of what Medallion is doing is trading currencies and commodities, not equities.

1005
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:56,700
Because you might be thinking, okay, yeah, I hear you.

1006
01:17:56,820 --> 01:17:58,260
The 90s was a different era.

1007
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:01,400
But half a billion-dollar fund doesn't sound that big.

1008
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:02,640
How are they moving markets?

1009
01:18:02,820 --> 01:18:03,980
With half a billion dollars.

1010
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:05,440
It's not the equity markets.

1011
01:18:05,620 --> 01:18:07,660
It's because they're in these thinner markets.

1012
01:18:07,660 --> 01:18:11,100
It's not that commodities and futures are small markets.

1013
01:18:11,260 --> 01:18:13,760
They're large, but they're thin compared to equities.

1014
01:18:14,060 --> 01:18:19,500
There's just not that much volume, and you just can't trade that much without slippage becoming a huge issue.

1015
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,780
And Medallion is now hitting that limit.

1016
01:18:22,780 --> 01:18:31,140
So Simons decides the only thing we can do here to expand, which I'm such a believer in what we're doing, we need to expand,

1017
01:18:31,140 --> 01:18:33,480
is we need to move into equities.

1018
01:18:34,160 --> 01:18:35,880
Equities are the holy grail.

1019
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:42,960
If we can make this work there, the depth in those markets will let us scale way, way, way bigger than we are now.

1020
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:50,160
And there's so much more data about equities pricing that we can feed into our models,

1021
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:55,440
and the signal processing that we can do and the signals that we can find are going to be even better.

1022
01:18:56,020 --> 01:18:56,040
Right.

1023
01:18:56,140 --> 01:19:00,940
There's so many buyers and sellers every day showing up to trade so many different companies.

1024
01:19:00,940 --> 01:19:06,600
At such high velocity, it's almost this honeypot for Renaissance's systems.

1025
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:08,080
This is sort of their moment.

1026
01:19:08,180 --> 01:19:13,040
This is what they were built for, and it's kind of funny that they've just been in kid-glove land the whole time

1027
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:15,700
with these thinly traded markets with minimal data.

1028
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:16,420
Yes.

1029
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:20,060
And this brings us to Peter Brown and Bob Mercer.

1030
01:19:20,680 --> 01:19:28,800
And in 1993, one of the mathematicians that Jim had recruited to Rentech, a guy named Nick Patterson,

1031
01:19:29,060 --> 01:19:29,800
gets especially...

1032
01:19:30,940 --> 01:19:34,800
Really passionate about going out and recruiting new talent along with Jim.

1033
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:37,460
And this is, I think, one of the keys to Rentech and the culture there.

1034
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:41,660
People want other smart people to come be there, too.

1035
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:43,620
Nick's sitting there like, this is a joy.

1036
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:46,900
I want to go find other best people in the world to hang out with.

1037
01:19:47,660 --> 01:19:54,820
And he had read in the newspaper that IBM was going through cost-cutting and was about to do layoffs.

1038
01:19:55,240 --> 01:20:00,820
And he also knew that the speech recognition group at IBM had some absolutely...

1039
01:20:00,940 --> 01:20:04,680
Absolutely fantastic mathematical talent.

1040
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:12,860
And really, what they were doing was, again, another vector in the early AI machine learning research.

1041
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:20,240
Specifically, IBM's deep blue chess project of the time had come out of this group.

1042
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:24,500
And Peter Brown there was the one that actually spearheaded the project.

1043
01:20:25,260 --> 01:20:25,340
Yep.

1044
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:29,680
And it's interesting that you talk about speech recognition as...

1045
01:20:30,940 --> 01:20:33,540
The perfect fit for what they were doing.

1046
01:20:33,580 --> 01:20:34,660
And you might say, why is that?

1047
01:20:34,660 --> 01:20:39,660
Well, the actual work that goes into speech recognition, natural language processing,

1048
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:44,800
is kind of the same signal processing that Renaissance is doing to analyze the market.

1049
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:45,940
It's not just kind of.

1050
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,760
It's exactly the same signal processing.

1051
01:20:47,980 --> 01:20:48,300
Right.

1052
01:20:48,500 --> 01:20:55,580
Speech recognition is a hidden Markov process where the computer that's listening to the sounds

1053
01:20:55,580 --> 01:20:59,760
to try to turn it into language doesn't actually know English, right?

1054
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:00,440
Obviously.

1055
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:05,620
But what it does know is, when I hear this set of frequencies and tonalities and sounds,

1056
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:09,340
there's a limited set of likely things that could come after it.

1057
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:12,820
And in Greg's book, he greatly points out this perfect example.

1058
01:21:13,160 --> 01:21:15,320
When I say apple, you might say pie.

1059
01:21:15,780 --> 01:21:20,560
The probability that pie is going to be the next word following apple is significantly higher.

1060
01:21:20,980 --> 01:21:24,800
And so these people who have spent their careers not only doing the math

1061
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:29,500
and the theoretical computer science behind speech recognition to help figure out and

1062
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:33,800
predict the next words, that you have a narrow set of likely words to choose from.

1063
01:21:33,900 --> 01:21:38,140
So when you're listening to those frequencies, you can say, it's probably going to be one

1064
01:21:38,140 --> 01:21:41,820
of these three, rather than search the entire dictionary for any word that it could be to

1065
01:21:41,820 --> 01:21:43,000
narrow the processing power.

1066
01:21:43,580 --> 01:21:48,700
It's not only the theoretical side, but it's also people who have built those systems at

1067
01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:51,680
IBM, like a real operational computer company.

1068
01:21:52,300 --> 01:21:54,560
Yes, at operational scale.

1069
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:58,280
And this is what's so important and why the two of them become,

1070
01:21:58,380 --> 01:21:59,480
probably.

1071
01:21:59,500 --> 01:22:05,260
The most critical hires in Rentec's history, even including all the great academics that

1072
01:22:05,260 --> 01:22:10,820
came before them, because they're good on the math side, but they have this large systems

1073
01:22:10,820 --> 01:22:11,480
experience.

1074
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:18,000
And Jim and Nick know that if they're going to move into equities because of the volume of data

1075
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:23,580
and because of how much more complex that market is, they need more complex systems.

1076
01:22:24,020 --> 01:22:28,100
And the current talent at Rentec coming from academia has just never experienced that or

1077
01:22:28,100 --> 01:22:29,060
built anything like it.

1078
01:22:29,060 --> 01:22:29,340
Yeah.

1079
01:22:29,340 --> 01:22:29,480
Yeah.

1080
01:22:29,500 --> 01:22:34,620
And the world that they're entering is just exploding in complexity and dimensionality.

1081
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:36,520
And when I say that, here's what I mean.

1082
01:22:37,100 --> 01:22:42,480
The data that they are mining, that they're looking for, is this intraday tick data between

1083
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:44,100
every stock trading.

1084
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:49,760
So they're in this sort of trying to map the relationship between one stock and every other

1085
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:53,220
stock, not just at that moment in time, but every time before it and every time after it.

1086
01:22:53,560 --> 01:22:59,220
They're also, once they do identify patterns, which this is key, the algorithms identify,

1087
01:22:59,500 --> 01:23:00,080
the patterns.

1088
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:05,780
It's not a human with a hunch saying, I think when oil prices go up, the airline prices are

1089
01:23:05,780 --> 01:23:06,280
going to get hit.

1090
01:23:06,580 --> 01:23:10,260
It's computers doing machine learning to discover the patterns in the data.

1091
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:16,840
Then there's the second piece of, well, what trades do you actually put on to be profitable

1092
01:23:16,840 --> 01:23:20,340
from the probabilities that you just discovered?

1093
01:23:20,440 --> 01:23:23,520
All these weights of relationships between all of these different companies.

1094
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:25,180
You're not just putting on one trade.

1095
01:23:25,180 --> 01:23:29,180
You're putting on 10, 100, thousands of simultaneous trades.

1096
01:23:29,180 --> 01:23:33,400
And both to hedge, to be able to isolate some particular variable that you're looking for,

1097
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:35,540
again, not you, but a computer is looking for.

1098
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:42,600
And you also need to do it in such specific bite sizes so that you don't move the market.

1099
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:49,380
So you're looking for a super multivariate, multidimensional problem, both on the data

1100
01:23:49,380 --> 01:23:52,980
ingestion side and on the how do I actually react to it side.

1101
01:23:52,980 --> 01:23:58,820
And all of this computation can't take a long time because you must act, you know, not in

1102
01:23:58,820 --> 01:23:59,600
milliseconds.

1103
01:23:59,960 --> 01:24:03,020
It's not a high frequency trading that's front running the market.

1104
01:24:03,180 --> 01:24:04,320
That's not actually what they do.

1105
01:24:04,420 --> 01:24:06,500
A lot of people think it is, but we'll get to that later.

1106
01:24:06,920 --> 01:24:10,820
But they do need to act with reasonable quickness, probably on the order of minutes.

1107
01:24:11,260 --> 01:24:14,280
So these need to be really efficient computer systems too.

1108
01:24:15,540 --> 01:24:22,080
And the universe of equities is so much more multidimensional and interrelated.

1109
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:26,480
There are only so many currencies in the world, and there are especially only so many currencies

1110
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:28,660
that are large enough trading markets.

1111
01:24:28,660 --> 01:24:28,800
There are so many currencies that are large enough trading markets.

1112
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:34,920
And there's not infinite, but thousands and thousands of equities in the world that are

1113
01:24:34,920 --> 01:24:36,800
deep enough markets that you can operate in.

1114
01:24:37,240 --> 01:24:40,160
And to some degree, they're all correlated with one another.

1115
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:43,680
And just keep adding layers of complexity here.

1116
01:24:43,780 --> 01:24:46,180
Keep adding new things to multiply by.

1117
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:48,600
Many of these are traded on multiple exchanges.

1118
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:54,700
So you might also be looking for pricing disparities on the same equity on different markets at

1119
01:24:54,700 --> 01:24:55,580
different points in time.

1120
01:24:55,580 --> 01:24:58,680
So there's just dimensions upon dimensions of things.

1121
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:00,540
And that's something that we need to analyze, correlate, and act upon.

1122
01:25:01,540 --> 01:25:04,860
So Patterson and Simons go raid IBM.

1123
01:25:05,060 --> 01:25:07,660
They're like Steve Jobs raiding Xerox PARC.

1124
01:25:07,880 --> 01:25:14,980
They bring Peter and Bob and one of their programming colleagues, David Magerman, over

1125
01:25:14,980 --> 01:25:16,920
from IBM into Rentech.

1126
01:25:17,480 --> 01:25:20,320
And they get started on building the equities model.

1127
01:25:20,820 --> 01:25:25,160
But it turns out, A, they're obviously very successful at that.

1128
01:25:25,160 --> 01:25:28,720
But the impact that they have and what they build.

1129
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:38,120
It's even bigger because Bob and Peter realize that, hey, actually, we should just have

1130
01:25:38,120 --> 01:25:44,480
one model for everything here, for currencies, for commodities, for equities.

1131
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:46,520
Everything is correlated.

1132
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:48,180
Everything is a signal.

1133
01:25:48,460 --> 01:25:53,840
It's not like the equities market is wholly independent and separate from what's happening

1134
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:55,760
in currencies or what's happening in commodities.

1135
01:25:56,260 --> 01:25:58,580
There are relationships everywhere.

1136
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:01,340
We really want just one model.

1137
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:06,940
This is like a fantastical undertaking, especially in the early to mid-90s.

1138
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:07,700
Right.

1139
01:26:07,700 --> 01:26:12,940
But if you can nail it, it means that you can do interesting things like, hey, we don't

1140
01:26:12,940 --> 01:26:19,500
have a lot of data on this particular market, but it looks a lot like something we do have

1141
01:26:19,500 --> 01:26:20,160
data on.

1142
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:24,320
So if it's all part of the same model, we can kind of just apply all the learnings from

1143
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:28,420
this other thing onto this brand new thing that we're looking at with little data for

1144
01:26:28,420 --> 01:26:28,780
the first time.

1145
01:26:28,780 --> 01:26:34,480
And because we're putting it all in one model and no one else in the world is, we can discover

1146
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:35,880
patterns that no one else knows about.

1147
01:26:36,540 --> 01:26:42,080
It turns out that this was actually the second most important innovation that Bob and Peter

1148
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:46,400
bring to Rentech, the actual product and performance of having one model.

1149
01:26:46,780 --> 01:26:54,680
The most important thing is that if you have only one model, one infrastructure, everybody

1150
01:26:54,680 --> 01:26:58,320
in the firm is working on that same model.

1151
01:26:58,780 --> 01:27:05,120
You can all collaborate all together, which is especially important when you have the

1152
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:08,360
smartest people in the entire world, all in one building.

1153
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:12,120
Before this, there were separate models within Rentech.

1154
01:27:12,260 --> 01:27:18,960
So insights and innovations and work that one team was doing on one model wouldn't get

1155
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:23,820
applied or translate over to work that was happening by another team on another model.

1156
01:27:24,140 --> 01:27:27,600
They did have the cultural element where it was encouraged that you share your learnings,

1157
01:27:27,660 --> 01:27:28,740
but someone would have to...

1158
01:27:28,780 --> 01:27:32,860
Take the time during their lunch break and go learn from you about those and then implement

1159
01:27:32,860 --> 01:27:33,740
it in their version.

1160
01:27:33,980 --> 01:27:36,200
There's a lag and it may actually not get implemented.

1161
01:27:36,200 --> 01:27:41,540
Yeah, this is wholly unique and revolutionary.

1162
01:27:42,360 --> 01:27:50,880
No other at-scale investment firm, period, and especially quant firm, operates this way

1163
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:52,400
today with just one model.

1164
01:27:52,920 --> 01:27:58,280
There are portfolio managers and teams and multi-strategy people are culturally competitive

1165
01:27:58,280 --> 01:27:58,760
with one another.

1166
01:27:58,780 --> 01:28:03,040
But even if they're not, the work that you're doing on this side of Citadel is not impacting

1167
01:28:03,040 --> 01:28:04,900
the work that you're doing on that side of Citadel.

1168
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:09,700
What Bob and Peter do is they unify everything at Rentech.

1169
01:28:09,780 --> 01:28:12,340
So all the wood is going behind one arrow.

1170
01:28:13,080 --> 01:28:13,340
Yes.

1171
01:28:14,040 --> 01:28:20,100
And before we talk about the impact of that, we want to thank our longtime friend of the

1172
01:28:20,100 --> 01:28:23,540
show, Vanta, the leading trust management platform.

1173
01:28:24,180 --> 01:28:27,840
Vanta, of course, automates your security reviews and compliance efforts.

1174
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:28,640
So frameworks like...

1175
01:28:28,780 --> 01:28:35,080
Like SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR, and HIPAA compliance and monitoring, which is quite topical if

1176
01:28:35,080 --> 01:28:39,620
you are in the heavily regulated finance industry and you need a lot of security and compliance.

1177
01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:43,980
Vanta takes care of these otherwise incredibly time and resource draining efforts for your

1178
01:28:43,980 --> 01:28:46,180
organization and makes them fast and simple.

1179
01:28:46,420 --> 01:28:50,540
Yeah, Vanta is the perfect example of the quote that we talk about all the time here

1180
01:28:50,540 --> 01:28:51,000
on Acquired.

1181
01:28:51,380 --> 01:28:56,060
Jeff Bezos, his idea that a company should only focus on what actually makes your beer

1182
01:28:56,060 --> 01:28:57,020
taste better.

1183
01:28:57,020 --> 01:28:57,760
I.e.

1184
01:28:57,760 --> 01:29:01,560
spend your time and resources only on what's actually going to move the needle for your

1185
01:29:01,560 --> 01:29:05,220
product and your customers and outsource everything else that doesn't.

1186
01:29:05,220 --> 01:29:07,880
In Rentech's case, this would be the model.

1187
01:29:08,540 --> 01:29:11,320
Every company needs compliance and trust with their vendors and customers.

1188
01:29:11,320 --> 01:29:15,480
It plays a major role in enabling revenue because customers and partners demand it,

1189
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:18,600
but yet it adds zero flavor to your actual product.

1190
01:29:19,140 --> 01:29:20,340
Vanta takes care of all of it for you.

1191
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:24,240
No more spreadsheets, no fragmented tools, no manual reviews to cobble together your

1192
01:29:24,240 --> 01:29:25,840
security and compliance requirements.

1193
01:29:26,200 --> 01:29:27,600
It is one single.

1194
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:32,040
Software pane of glass, just like one model that connects to all of your services via

1195
01:29:32,040 --> 01:29:35,800
APIs and eliminates countless hours of work for your organization.

1196
01:29:36,280 --> 01:29:40,280
There are now AI capabilities to make this even more powerful, and they even integrate

1197
01:29:40,280 --> 01:29:42,460
with over 300 external tools.

1198
01:29:42,700 --> 01:29:45,980
Plus, they let customers build private integrations with their internal systems.

1199
01:29:46,500 --> 01:29:50,540
And perhaps most importantly, your security reviews are now real time instead of static,

1200
01:29:50,540 --> 01:29:54,720
so you can monitor and share with your customers and partners to give them added confidence.

1201
01:29:54,720 --> 01:29:56,880
So whether you're a startup or a large enterprise,

1202
01:29:56,880 --> 01:30:00,480
and your company is ready to automate compliance and streamline security reviews

1203
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:05,100
like Vanta's 7,000 customers around the globe, and go back to making your beer taste better,

1204
01:30:05,340 --> 01:30:09,940
head on over to vanta.com slash acquired and just tell them that Ben and David sent you.

1205
01:30:10,360 --> 01:30:13,380
And thanks to friend of the show, Christina, Vanta's CEO,

1206
01:30:13,700 --> 01:30:17,160
all acquired listeners get $1,000 of free credit.

1207
01:30:17,560 --> 01:30:19,320
Vanta.com slash acquired.

1208
01:30:20,140 --> 01:30:22,700
So David, the equities machine.

1209
01:30:23,440 --> 01:30:26,120
Yes, and indeed a machine it is.

1210
01:30:26,360 --> 01:30:26,860
So David, the equities machine.

1211
01:30:26,860 --> 01:30:32,460
So Peter and Bob come in in 1993, and 1994, 1995, they're building this,

1212
01:30:32,820 --> 01:30:34,180
Rentech is getting into equities.

1213
01:30:34,680 --> 01:30:39,700
And yeah, just imagine the computers that you were using during 1994 and 1995.

1214
01:30:40,200 --> 01:30:45,880
It is astonishing the level of computational complexity and coordination and results

1215
01:30:45,880 --> 01:30:49,960
that they are pulling off, again, in real time, analyzing these markets

1216
01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:52,660
with the technology that was available during those years.

1217
01:30:52,660 --> 01:30:55,320
Yes, and here's what's amazing.

1218
01:30:55,320 --> 01:31:02,780
Returns go down maybe slightly, certainly a bit from the blowout year that 1994 was,

1219
01:31:03,100 --> 01:31:08,980
but they're still above 30% every single year, most years above 40%.

1220
01:31:08,980 --> 01:31:12,580
This is unbelievable that they're maintaining this performance

1221
01:31:12,580 --> 01:31:16,300
as they're going into this hugely more complex market,

1222
01:31:16,300 --> 01:31:18,840
and they're scaling assets under management.

1223
01:31:19,120 --> 01:31:24,480
So by the end of the 1990s, Medallion has almost $2 billion in assets under management.

1224
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:30,100
While maintaining roughly the same performance by getting into equities.

1225
01:31:30,500 --> 01:31:32,220
This is huge.

1226
01:31:32,620 --> 01:31:33,140
Yep.

1227
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:35,960
And David, if you just kind of look at this and do the math.

1228
01:31:36,140 --> 01:31:43,660
Okay, so 94, their AUM was $276 million, and they grew 93%.

1229
01:31:43,660 --> 01:31:48,800
And then their AUM the next year was $462 million, and then they grew 52%.

1230
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:51,680
And their AUM the next year was $637 million.

1231
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:53,960
You kind of quickly get where I'm going here, which is,

1232
01:31:53,960 --> 01:31:57,540
oh, they're scaling AUM not by bringing in new investors.

1233
01:31:58,060 --> 01:31:59,160
Right, it's closed to new investors.

1234
01:31:59,380 --> 01:32:00,780
It's all just compounding.

1235
01:32:01,120 --> 01:32:04,420
This is the same capital that they had in 1993

1236
01:32:04,420 --> 01:32:11,640
that has gone from $122 million at the beginning of that year to 1999 being $1.5 billion.

1237
01:32:12,320 --> 01:32:12,640
Yes.

1238
01:32:13,040 --> 01:32:18,520
And then in the year 2000, they just totally blow the doors off.

1239
01:32:18,520 --> 01:32:23,740
A 128% gross returns.

1240
01:32:23,960 --> 01:32:30,600
Net returns after fees of 98.5%.

1241
01:32:30,600 --> 01:32:32,500
This is bananas.

1242
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:38,680
They grow the fund from $1.9 billion to $3.8 billion of asset center management.

1243
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:42,840
Again, purely by investing gains, not by getting any new investors.

1244
01:32:43,280 --> 01:32:45,420
The year the tech bubble burst.

1245
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:46,240
Yes.

1246
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:50,420
While the whole rest of the market is down big time,

1247
01:32:51,100 --> 01:32:53,560
Medallion is up 128%.

1248
01:32:53,960 --> 01:32:55,520
Gross on the air.

1249
01:32:55,580 --> 01:32:56,440
And this becomes a theme.

1250
01:32:56,440 --> 01:32:59,960
High volatility is when Medallion really shines.

1251
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:02,540
And here you go, uncorrelated.

1252
01:33:02,700 --> 01:33:06,440
They have their final stamp of approval right here of,

1253
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:08,920
not only are we a money printing machine,

1254
01:33:09,260 --> 01:33:12,160
we are a money printing machine in all environments,

1255
01:33:12,340 --> 01:33:14,160
regardless of the state of the broad market.

1256
01:33:14,580 --> 01:33:15,600
And David, as you said,

1257
01:33:15,940 --> 01:33:18,960
volatility actually makes their algorithms work even better.

1258
01:33:19,040 --> 01:33:19,860
Because what are they doing?

1259
01:33:20,160 --> 01:33:23,780
They're looking for scenarios where the market's going to

1260
01:33:23,780 --> 01:33:23,940
actually be able to do something.

1261
01:33:23,960 --> 01:33:28,460
And they can take advantage of people making decisions that they shouldn't.

1262
01:33:28,780 --> 01:33:30,820
And any time any investors are under pressure,

1263
01:33:31,280 --> 01:33:33,920
there's a little bit of edge that's going to accrue to a Medallion

1264
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:36,760
that's saying, oh, okay, you're fear selling right now.

1265
01:33:37,020 --> 01:33:40,240
Well, I can determine if you should be fear selling or not.

1266
01:33:40,340 --> 01:33:43,460
And if I determine that you shouldn't be dumping that asset, I'm buying it from you.

1267
01:33:44,120 --> 01:33:47,660
So there's a really fun story around this that really illustrates

1268
01:33:47,660 --> 01:33:52,360
Jim's genius in managing the firm and the people.

1269
01:33:53,080 --> 01:33:53,940
And, you know, I don't know if you've heard of it, but I've heard of it.

1270
01:33:53,940 --> 01:33:57,320
How this year was when they really figured this out.

1271
01:33:57,480 --> 01:34:02,040
So the first couple days of the tech bubble bursting,

1272
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:06,040
Medallion actually takes a bunch of large losses.

1273
01:34:06,540 --> 01:34:10,160
And part of it might be that the model wasn't tuned right yet

1274
01:34:10,160 --> 01:34:13,440
because nobody at Rentech had seen this type of behavior in the market before.

1275
01:34:14,020 --> 01:34:17,920
Part of it might also be, too, that it didn't perform well for those couple days.

1276
01:34:18,200 --> 01:34:21,020
It's a really stressful time for everybody.

1277
01:34:21,020 --> 01:34:23,600
You know, everybody's in Jim's office.

1278
01:34:23,940 --> 01:34:25,100
Jim's smoking his cigarettes.

1279
01:34:25,300 --> 01:34:26,200
It's a cloud of smoke.

1280
01:34:26,600 --> 01:34:28,020
And they're debating what to do.

1281
01:34:28,100 --> 01:34:30,600
And Jim makes the call to take some risk off.

1282
01:34:30,920 --> 01:34:32,280
He's worried about blowing up.

1283
01:34:32,440 --> 01:34:35,580
We're not very far removed at this point from long-term capital management.

1284
01:34:36,160 --> 01:34:40,640
The model may be saying we should stay long here, but let's not blow up the firm.

1285
01:34:41,140 --> 01:34:41,240
Yep.

1286
01:34:41,980 --> 01:34:47,280
After this goes down, Peter Brown comes to Jim and offers to resign,

1287
01:34:47,820 --> 01:34:50,840
given the losses that they incurred over these couple days.

1288
01:34:51,040 --> 01:34:53,420
And Jim says, what are you talking about?

1289
01:34:53,420 --> 01:34:55,000
Of course you shouldn't resign.

1290
01:34:55,220 --> 01:34:59,460
You are way more valuable to the firm now that you've lived through this,

1291
01:34:59,560 --> 01:35:04,160
and you now know not to 100% trust the model in all situations.

1292
01:35:04,440 --> 01:35:05,200
It's fascinating.

1293
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:06,740
It's such a good insight.

1294
01:35:06,940 --> 01:35:09,240
That illustrates Jim as a leader right there.

1295
01:35:09,500 --> 01:35:10,520
It totally does.

1296
01:35:10,700 --> 01:35:16,400
There's a parallel story when Jim ultimately does retire in 2009

1297
01:35:16,400 --> 01:35:19,300
and Peter and Bob take over as co-CEOs,

1298
01:35:19,560 --> 01:35:23,240
where a year or so before the quote-unquote quant quake,

1299
01:35:23,420 --> 01:35:26,080
had happened, where similar to the tech bubble bursting,

1300
01:35:26,580 --> 01:35:30,000
there was all of a sudden very large drawdowns

1301
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:33,340
among all quantitative firms in the market and rent tech gets hit.

1302
01:35:34,120 --> 01:35:38,520
And during that period, Peter argued very strenuously

1303
01:35:38,520 --> 01:35:41,860
that we should trust the model, stay risk on,

1304
01:35:41,960 --> 01:35:44,340
this is going to be an incredibly profitable time for us.

1305
01:35:44,820 --> 01:35:48,940
And Jim pumped the brakes and stepped in, intervened and took risk off.

1306
01:35:49,720 --> 01:35:53,360
And Peter goes to Jim again around the CEO,

1307
01:35:53,420 --> 01:35:54,320
transition and says,

1308
01:35:54,380 --> 01:35:58,040
hey, Jim, aren't you worried that with me running the place now,

1309
01:35:58,100 --> 01:36:00,520
I'm going to be too aggressive and blow it up one of these days?

1310
01:36:00,820 --> 01:36:03,500
And Jim says, no, I'm not worried at all.

1311
01:36:03,900 --> 01:36:07,040
I know you were only so aggressive in that moment

1312
01:36:07,040 --> 01:36:09,140
because I was there pushing back on you.

1313
01:36:09,220 --> 01:36:12,120
And when you're in the seat, you're going to be less aggressive.

1314
01:36:12,260 --> 01:36:15,360
He's just such a master at insight into human behavior.

1315
01:36:15,680 --> 01:36:16,580
It is so true, though.

1316
01:36:16,680 --> 01:36:20,360
I even find this about myself that I will naturally take the position

1317
01:36:20,360 --> 01:36:22,460
of the foil to the person across from me.

1318
01:36:22,460 --> 01:36:23,360
So if somebody,

1319
01:36:23,420 --> 01:36:24,980
if somebody's being pushy in some way,

1320
01:36:25,040 --> 01:36:28,240
I'll find myself taking a position where if I pause and reflect,

1321
01:36:28,300 --> 01:36:30,500
I'm like, I don't think I expected to take this position

1322
01:36:30,500 --> 01:36:31,560
coming into this conversation.

1323
01:36:31,740 --> 01:36:35,820
But, you know, you naturally want to sort of play the other side

1324
01:36:35,820 --> 01:36:38,220
to balance out the person sitting across from you.

1325
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:38,900
Yeah.

1326
01:36:39,540 --> 01:36:42,960
So back to the year 2000 and this incredible performance.

1327
01:36:43,240 --> 01:36:46,300
Ben, to what you were saying earlier about uncorrelated returns,

1328
01:36:46,660 --> 01:36:48,900
not only did they shoot the lights out that year,

1329
01:36:49,020 --> 01:36:50,840
they're doing it when the market is down.

1330
01:36:51,460 --> 01:36:52,940
We got to introduce this concept

1331
01:36:52,940 --> 01:36:53,400
of a sharp return.

1332
01:36:53,420 --> 01:36:56,820
Which for all of you listeners that are in the finance world,

1333
01:36:56,940 --> 01:36:57,480
you'll know this.

1334
01:36:57,740 --> 01:37:00,200
But for everybody else, this is a really important concept.

1335
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:02,420
And I think people grasp it intuitively.

1336
01:37:02,920 --> 01:37:06,120
We've mentioned this concept a couple times this episode where,

1337
01:37:06,760 --> 01:37:07,380
OK, great.

1338
01:37:07,660 --> 01:37:10,960
It's amazing to have a fund that 25Xs

1339
01:37:10,960 --> 01:37:14,200
or a year where you have 100% investment return

1340
01:37:14,200 --> 01:37:17,520
or I bought Bitcoin yesterday and it doubled overnight.

1341
01:37:17,980 --> 01:37:20,280
Does that make you one of the best investors in the world?

1342
01:37:20,360 --> 01:37:21,540
We all intuitively know.

1343
01:37:21,540 --> 01:37:22,520
No, it doesn't.

1344
01:37:22,520 --> 01:37:24,960
Because maybe that was a fluke.

1345
01:37:25,400 --> 01:37:28,000
Maybe you're taking on an extreme amount of risk.

1346
01:37:28,400 --> 01:37:31,560
And then the question is always adjusting for the risk that you're taking.

1347
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:35,840
Can you produce a superior return taking the risk into that account?

1348
01:37:36,180 --> 01:37:40,720
And so you basically can provide value to investors as a fund manager in two ways.

1349
01:37:41,020 --> 01:37:45,360
You can outperform the market or you can be entirely uncorrelated with the market

1350
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:46,520
and get market returns.

1351
01:37:46,760 --> 01:37:49,640
Or what you can do as rent tech is both.

1352
01:37:49,640 --> 01:37:51,640
You can be uncorrelated and,

1353
01:37:52,520 --> 01:37:53,120
effectively, outperform,

1354
01:37:53,320 --> 01:37:55,940
which is effectively the holy grail of money management.

1355
01:37:56,580 --> 01:37:56,660
Yes.

1356
01:37:56,860 --> 01:38:00,920
And so the Sharpe ratio is a measurement combining these two concepts.

1357
01:38:01,080 --> 01:38:01,460
Exactly.

1358
01:38:01,900 --> 01:38:04,700
So it's named after the economist William F. Sharpe.

1359
01:38:04,780 --> 01:38:06,240
It was pioneered in 1966.

1360
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:12,020
It is effectively the measure of a fund's performance relative to the risk-free rate.

1361
01:38:12,340 --> 01:38:17,200
So if you performed at 15% that year and the risk-free rate was 3%,

1362
01:38:17,720 --> 01:38:20,880
then your numerator is going to be 12%.

1363
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:22,200
And it is compared, again,

1364
01:38:22,520 --> 01:38:26,280
against the volatility or the standard deviation is technically what it is.

1365
01:38:26,360 --> 01:38:30,800
But effectively, how volatile have you been the last X years?

1366
01:38:30,920 --> 01:38:34,740
And typically, it's looked at as a 3-year Sharpe or a 5-year Sharpe or a 10-year Sharpe.

1367
01:38:35,140 --> 01:38:38,560
The Sharpe ratio represents the additional amount of return

1368
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:43,320
that an investor receives per unit of an increase in risk.

1369
01:38:43,700 --> 01:38:45,360
And so, David, you're starting to throw out numbers.

1370
01:38:45,820 --> 01:38:47,280
Low Sharpe ratios are bad.

1371
01:38:47,560 --> 01:38:50,620
Negative Sharpe ratios are worse because that means you're underperforming

1372
01:38:50,620 --> 01:38:51,580
the risk-free rate.

1373
01:38:51,580 --> 01:38:51,860
High Sharpe ratios are bad.

1374
01:38:51,860 --> 01:38:54,980
High Sharpe ratios are good because it means that you're producing lots of returns

1375
01:38:54,980 --> 01:38:59,020
and your variance or your standard deviation or your sort of risk is low.

1376
01:38:59,500 --> 01:39:06,400
So in 1990, they had a Sharpe of 2.0, which was twice that of the S&P 500 benchmark.

1377
01:39:06,620 --> 01:39:06,840
Awesome.

1378
01:39:07,220 --> 01:39:07,360
Yep.

1379
01:39:07,640 --> 01:39:07,840
Good.

1380
01:39:08,200 --> 01:39:11,540
1995 to 2000, Sharpe ratio of 2.5.

1381
01:39:11,920 --> 01:39:12,960
Really starting to hum.

1382
01:39:13,140 --> 01:39:13,800
Pretty unbelievable.

1383
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:14,620
Good.

1384
01:39:15,080 --> 01:39:16,400
Where do I sign up to invest?

1385
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:21,760
At some point, they added foreign markets and achieved a Sharpe ratio of 6.3.

1386
01:39:21,860 --> 01:39:24,440
Which is double the best quant firms.

1387
01:39:25,040 --> 01:39:29,620
This is a firm that has almost no chance of losing money, at least historically,

1388
01:39:29,860 --> 01:39:34,000
and massively outperforms the market on an uncorrelated basis.

1389
01:39:35,020 --> 01:39:39,560
And I believe, if I have my research right, in 2004,

1390
01:39:40,300 --> 01:39:43,720
they actually achieved a Sharpe ratio of 7.5.

1391
01:39:44,120 --> 01:39:44,720
Astonishing.

1392
01:39:45,300 --> 01:39:47,440
You know, again, back to our sports analogy here.

1393
01:39:47,500 --> 01:39:48,600
These aren't Hall of Fame numbers.

1394
01:39:48,600 --> 01:39:50,720
These are like, I don't know,

1395
01:39:50,820 --> 01:39:51,700
make Tom Brady look like a star.

1396
01:39:51,700 --> 01:39:51,840
These are like, I don't know, make Tom Brady look like a star.

1397
01:39:51,860 --> 01:39:52,700
Like a third stringer.

1398
01:39:52,860 --> 01:39:53,680
Yes, exactly.

1399
01:39:54,660 --> 01:39:57,760
So, on the back of 2000 and this rise,

1400
01:39:58,300 --> 01:39:59,900
the next year in 2001,

1401
01:40:00,380 --> 01:40:05,040
they raise the carried interest on the fund to 36%,

1402
01:40:05,040 --> 01:40:08,260
up from either 20 or 25%, whatever it was before.

1403
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:12,260
Now, remember, they've already closed the fund to new investors.

1404
01:40:12,420 --> 01:40:14,480
So, there's still outside investors in the fund,

1405
01:40:15,040 --> 01:40:16,840
but no new investors are coming in.

1406
01:40:17,460 --> 01:40:19,900
And then, the next year, in 2002,

1407
01:40:20,440 --> 01:40:21,840
they raise the carried interest on the fund to 36%.

1408
01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:30,400
to 44%. I mean, great work if you can get it. But for context, the Sequoias, the benchmarks out

1409
01:40:30,400 --> 01:40:37,020
there, they have obscene carry of 30%. 44% is unprecedented. There's two interesting ways to

1410
01:40:37,020 --> 01:40:42,220
look at this. One, they're just trying to jack it up so high that they just purge their existing

1411
01:40:42,220 --> 01:40:45,600
investors out, where they're saying, we're not going to kick anyone out yet, but we've been

1412
01:40:45,600 --> 01:40:49,540
closed to new business for a long time now. You should see yourself out at some point.

1413
01:40:49,540 --> 01:40:53,360
The other way to look at this, which I think is probably the right way to look at it, is

1414
01:40:53,360 --> 01:41:00,240
investors are arbitragers. They see a mispricing, they come into the market,

1415
01:41:00,520 --> 01:41:07,100
they fix that mispricing. So anytime that there's an opportunity to bring the way that a currency

1416
01:41:07,100 --> 01:41:11,680
is trading on two different exchanges closer together, investors are serving their purpose

1417
01:41:11,680 --> 01:41:16,480
of coming in, arbitraging that difference, taking a little bit of profit as a thank you,

1418
01:41:16,480 --> 01:41:19,360
and then sort of fixing the market to make the market a true

1419
01:41:19,360 --> 01:41:19,520
market.

1420
01:41:19,540 --> 01:41:22,880
Weighing machine, not a voting machine, but making it so that all prices reflect

1421
01:41:22,880 --> 01:41:28,620
the value of what something is actually worth. And in some ways, that's what Renaissance is

1422
01:41:28,620 --> 01:41:32,460
doing here to themselves or to their investors. They're coming in and saying, look, this is

1423
01:41:32,460 --> 01:41:38,440
obscene. We so clearly outperformed the market. You're still going to take this deal, even if we

1424
01:41:38,440 --> 01:41:43,720
take more of this, because there's just a mispricing here. This product should not be priced at 20,

1425
01:41:43,800 --> 01:41:48,380
25% carry. This product should be priced at a much higher carried interest, and you're still

1426
01:41:48,380 --> 01:41:48,920
going to love it.

1427
01:41:48,920 --> 01:41:55,840
You should pay 20% carry for a firm that delivers you 15% annual returns. We're delivering you

1428
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:58,480
50% annual returns.

1429
01:41:59,020 --> 01:42:02,620
Totally. So I have to imagine it didn't go over well with the existing investors,

1430
01:42:02,780 --> 01:42:05,520
but they just have so much leverage that what's going to happen?

1431
01:42:06,120 --> 01:42:10,460
Okay. Once again, I'm sorry, audience. I have to say, hold on one more minute

1432
01:42:10,460 --> 01:42:16,640
for another perspective that I have to offer on the carry element, but I want to finish the story

1433
01:42:16,640 --> 01:42:18,900
first. Okay. So 2001, they raised a carry. They raised a carry. They raised a carry. They raised a carry.

1434
01:42:18,900 --> 01:42:26,080
They raised a carry to 36%. 2002, they raised it to 44%. And then in 2003, they actually say,

1435
01:42:26,300 --> 01:42:30,300
hey, we can't incentivize you out of the fund, outside investors. We are going to kick you out.

1436
01:42:30,660 --> 01:42:35,100
So starting in 2003, everybody who's an outside investor, who's not part of the rent tech

1437
01:42:35,100 --> 01:42:40,480
family, current employee or alumni of the firm, gets kicked out.

1438
01:42:41,040 --> 01:42:44,700
And not all alumni get to stay. There's select alumni that get grandfathered in.

1439
01:42:44,980 --> 01:42:48,720
Yes. Now, why did we do this? I'm going to talk about one reason,

1440
01:42:48,740 --> 01:42:48,880
and I'm going to talk about another reason, and I'm going to talk about another reason,

1441
01:42:48,900 --> 01:42:54,840
but one reason is super obvious. The Medallion Fund is now at $5 billion in assets under

1442
01:42:54,840 --> 01:42:59,920
management that they're trading. Even in the equities market, they are now hitting up against

1443
01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:07,320
slippage. And so if they want to maintain this crazy, crazy performance, they just can't get

1444
01:43:07,320 --> 01:43:11,880
that much bigger. This is the problem that Warren Buffett talks about all the time and why he has

1445
01:43:11,880 --> 01:43:16,520
to basically just increase his position in Apple rather than going and buying the next great family

1446
01:43:16,520 --> 01:43:18,740
owned business. The things that move the needle for the next great family owned business are the

1447
01:43:18,740 --> 01:43:24,600
are so big that that's really all they can do. And when you are big, you're going to move any

1448
01:43:24,600 --> 01:43:30,380
market that you enter into. And the strategy that rent tech is employing right now, they're just

1449
01:43:30,380 --> 01:43:36,820
deeming doesn't work at north of $5 billion. So in 2003, they start kicking all the outside

1450
01:43:36,820 --> 01:43:42,880
investors out of Medallion. But clearly, there's still lots of institutional demand to invest

1451
01:43:42,880 --> 01:43:48,280
with Renaissance. So what do they do? Well, time to start another fund.

1452
01:43:48,280 --> 01:43:55,060
So they start the Renaissance Institutional Equities Fund. And there's a couple of things

1453
01:43:55,060 --> 01:43:59,340
to add a little bit of context to really why they decide to do this. Well, the first one is

1454
01:43:59,340 --> 01:44:04,720
sometimes there's just more profitable strategies than they had the capital to take advantage of

1455
01:44:04,720 --> 01:44:09,900
in Medallion, but they weren't sure it would be on a durable basis. If they were sure that

1456
01:44:09,900 --> 01:44:16,040
they could manage 10, 15, 20, 25 billion in Medallion all the time, then they would grow

1457
01:44:16,040 --> 01:44:18,260
to that. But if just sometimes there's these strategies that are more profitable, then they

1458
01:44:18,280 --> 01:44:22,780
appear, well, we don't want to commit to a much higher fund size and then not always have those

1459
01:44:22,780 --> 01:44:28,760
strategies available. The other thing is that a lot of the times those strategies aren't really

1460
01:44:28,760 --> 01:44:34,500
what Medallion is set up to do. They require longer hold times. And so there's a little bit

1461
01:44:34,500 --> 01:44:39,640
of downside to that because these new strategies, the predictive abilities are less because they

1462
01:44:39,640 --> 01:44:44,040
have to predict further into the future to understand what the exit prices will be on

1463
01:44:44,040 --> 01:44:48,220
these longer term holds. But they still figure, hey, even though it's not quite our

1464
01:44:48,280 --> 01:44:52,340
bread and butter with the short term stuff, we should be able to make some money doing it.

1465
01:44:52,960 --> 01:44:59,040
Yeah, there's a fun story around this that Peter Brown tells of Jim came into his office one day

1466
01:44:59,040 --> 01:45:05,920
and said, Peter, I got a thought exercise for you. If you married a Rockefeller, would you advise

1467
01:45:05,920 --> 01:45:12,300
the family that they should invest a large portion of their wealth in the S&P 500? And Peter says,

1468
01:45:12,380 --> 01:45:17,400
no, of course not. That's not a great risk adjusted return. And these guys are very used to

1469
01:45:17,400 --> 01:45:18,240
sharp ratios.

1470
01:45:18,280 --> 01:45:19,760
That are far better than the S&P.

1471
01:45:20,280 --> 01:45:26,160
Right. And so Jim says, yes, exactly. Now get to work on designing the product that they should

1472
01:45:26,160 --> 01:45:26,760
invest in.

1473
01:45:27,260 --> 01:45:31,760
Right. And so that's basically what they come up with is, can we create something that's

1474
01:45:31,760 --> 01:45:37,320
like an S&P 500 with a higher sharp ratio? Can we beat the market by a few percentage points or

1475
01:45:37,320 --> 01:45:41,360
frankly, even match the market each year with lower volatility than if they were buying an

1476
01:45:41,360 --> 01:45:46,280
index fund? And you can see who this would be very attractive to pensions, large institutions,

1477
01:45:47,120 --> 01:45:48,260
firms that want to come in and buy an index fund. And so they come up with a very attractive

1478
01:45:48,280 --> 01:45:54,800
compound at market or slightly above market rate, but don't want to risk these massive drawdowns or

1479
01:45:54,800 --> 01:45:59,480
frankly, just big volatility in general, should they need to pull the capital earlier. And the

1480
01:45:59,480 --> 01:46:03,840
nice thing about being invested in a hedge fund versus a venture fund is you can do redemptions.

1481
01:46:03,920 --> 01:46:08,940
Like if you look at the 13 Fs, the SEC documents that the Renaissance Institutional Equities Fund

1482
01:46:08,940 --> 01:46:12,800
files over time, it changes every quarter because there's new people putting money in,

1483
01:46:12,860 --> 01:46:17,600
there's people doing redemption. So it's a pretty good product, or at least the theory behind it is

1484
01:46:17,600 --> 01:46:18,260
a pretty good product. And so if you're investing in a hedge fund versus a venture fund, you can do

1485
01:46:18,280 --> 01:46:23,640
of a lower risk, similar return thing to the S&P 500.

1486
01:46:24,460 --> 01:46:29,540
And the marketing is built in. It's not like there's any lack of demand of outside capital

1487
01:46:29,540 --> 01:46:33,360
that wants to invest with rent tech. Right. It's really funny. There's

1488
01:46:33,360 --> 01:46:36,460
all these stories about how the marketing documents literally say, this is not the

1489
01:46:36,460 --> 01:46:40,700
Medallion Fund. We don't promise returns like the Medallion Fund. In fact, we're not charging for it

1490
01:46:40,700 --> 01:46:45,540
like the Medallion Fund. David, you said that the fees and carry on Medallion went up to what,

1491
01:46:45,540 --> 01:46:48,100
5 and 44. Well, on the institutional,

1492
01:46:48,280 --> 01:46:53,720
fund, the fees are 1 in 10. You're only taking 1% annual fee and 10% of the performance.

1493
01:46:54,040 --> 01:46:58,420
Clearly, this is a very different product. But people did not perceive that. People were very

1494
01:46:58,420 --> 01:47:01,980
excited. It's a Renaissance product. It's the same analysts. They're using all their fancy

1495
01:47:01,980 --> 01:47:05,880
computers. I'm sure we're going to get this crazy outperformance. And at the end of the day,

1496
01:47:05,940 --> 01:47:11,740
it is an extremely different vehicle. Yeah. That has not performed anywhere

1497
01:47:11,740 --> 01:47:18,180
near how Medallion has performed. Correct. Has it served its purpose? Yeah. But is it Medallion? No.

1498
01:47:18,280 --> 01:47:24,460
It's not special in the way that Medallion is special. Yes. A couple other funny things on the

1499
01:47:24,460 --> 01:47:30,300
institutional fund. So I spent a bunch of time scrolling through 13Fs over the last decade from

1500
01:47:30,300 --> 01:47:34,120
the Medallion filings. And they're all from, I think they have two institutional funds.

1501
01:47:34,700 --> 01:47:37,800
Yeah. There's Institutional Equities and Diversified Alpha.

1502
01:47:38,440 --> 01:47:43,400
So the funniest thing is they file these 13Fs. And David and I are very used to looking at the 13Fs of

1503
01:47:43,400 --> 01:47:47,800
friends of the show who run hedge funds, who we've had on as guests, or perhaps,

1504
01:47:47,800 --> 01:47:51,240
really just any investor where you want to see like, or what are they buying and selling this

1505
01:47:51,240 --> 01:47:57,740
quarter? And usually you see 15, 25, maybe 50 different names on there. Well, the 13F

1506
01:47:57,740 --> 01:48:04,280
for Renaissance has 4,300 stocks in these tiny little chunks. And there's a little bit of

1507
01:48:04,280 --> 01:48:08,440
persistence quarter to quarter. For example, weirdly, Novo Nordisk has been one of their

1508
01:48:08,440 --> 01:48:12,960
biggest holdings, biggest, I say at like one to 2%. That's their biggest position

1509
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:16,220
for several quarters in a row. Hey, they've been listening to a choir.

1510
01:48:16,220 --> 01:48:16,900
That's right.

1511
01:48:17,800 --> 01:48:18,540
Signals in the model.

1512
01:48:19,880 --> 01:48:27,180
You kind of get the sense from looking at these filings that these things were flying all over

1513
01:48:27,180 --> 01:48:31,020
the place. And this was just the moment in time where they decided to take a snapshot

1514
01:48:31,020 --> 01:48:35,220
and put it on a piece of paper. And even though this is the end of quarter filing of what their

1515
01:48:35,220 --> 01:48:40,260
ownership was, if you had taken it a day or a week earlier, it could look completely different.

1516
01:48:41,100 --> 01:48:46,820
Yes. The way that some folks we talked to described the difference between the institutional

1517
01:48:46,820 --> 01:48:47,780
funds and medallions is that they're not going to be able to do that. They're going to have to

1518
01:48:47,780 --> 01:48:48,160
hold their position for a whole month. And they're going to have to hold their position for a whole month.

1519
01:48:48,160 --> 01:48:49,300
So that's the way that medallions are doing it. And that's what I call the medallion to us is that

1520
01:48:49,300 --> 01:48:56,980
medallions average hold time for their trades and positions is call it like a day, maybe a day and a

1521
01:48:56,980 --> 01:49:03,120
half. Whereas the average hold time for the institutional funds positions is like a couple

1522
01:49:03,120 --> 01:49:10,560
months. So across 4,300 stocks in the portfolio, there's a lot of trading activity that happens on

1523
01:49:10,560 --> 01:49:17,460
any given day. But it's a lot slower in any given name than medallion would be.

1524
01:49:17,780 --> 01:49:22,680
Which makes sense. Again, it gets back to this slippage concept. If you have a bigger fund and

1525
01:49:22,680 --> 01:49:27,460
you're investing larger amounts, which the institutional funds are, you can't be trading

1526
01:49:27,460 --> 01:49:32,940
as frequently or all of your gains are going to slip away. Yep. And frankly, it just looks a lot

1527
01:49:32,940 --> 01:49:38,440
like the S&P 500. Like when you look at as of November 23, so 11 of the 12 months of the year

1528
01:49:38,440 --> 01:49:45,020
had happened, they were up 8.6%. Okay. That sounds like an index type return. You look at the first

1529
01:49:45,020 --> 01:49:50,920
four months of 2020, right after the crazy dip from the pandemic, they were down 10.4%. Less

1530
01:49:50,920 --> 01:49:55,520
than the broader market, but they still were sort of a mirror of the broader market. So I think

1531
01:49:55,520 --> 01:50:03,180
the RIEF, their institutional fund, yes, it works as expected. No, it's not medallion. And if it

1532
01:50:03,180 --> 01:50:07,020
were standing on its own, there's zero chance that we would be covering the organization behind it

1533
01:50:07,020 --> 01:50:12,520
unacquired. Zero percent chance. Speaking of the fund, that is the reason why we are covering

1534
01:50:12,520 --> 01:50:14,400
this company on this show.

1535
01:50:15,020 --> 01:50:20,540
We set up during the tech bubble crash that volatility is when medallion really shines.

1536
01:50:20,960 --> 01:50:31,160
Well, there's no more volatile periods than 2007 and 2008. Yep. 2007, medallion does 136%

1537
01:50:31,160 --> 01:50:43,320
gross. 2008, medallion does 152% gross. Like get out of here. Crazy. This is 2008 while the rest

1538
01:50:43,320 --> 01:50:45,000
of the financial world is melting.

1539
01:50:45,020 --> 01:50:49,300
And so this really does illustrate where do they make their money from? Who is on the other side

1540
01:50:49,300 --> 01:50:54,080
of these trades? It's people acting emotionally. They have effectively these really robust models

1541
01:50:54,080 --> 01:51:00,380
that are highly unemotional, that are making these super intricate multi-security bets.

1542
01:51:00,620 --> 01:51:05,440
And they are putting on exactly the right set of trades to achieve the risk and exposure that the

1543
01:51:05,440 --> 01:51:11,220
system wants them to have. And who is on the other side of those trades? It's panic sellers.

1544
01:51:11,460 --> 01:51:15,000
It's dentists. It's hedge funds who don't trust their computer.

1545
01:51:15,020 --> 01:51:19,540
They're like, ah, crap. We got to just take risk off, even though it's a negative expected value

1546
01:51:19,540 --> 01:51:24,700
move for us. They're basically trading against human nature. And importantly, in this business

1547
01:51:24,700 --> 01:51:28,860
versus every other business that we cover here on Acquired or most other businesses, this is truly

1548
01:51:28,860 --> 01:51:34,380
zero sum. It's not like they're here in an industry that's a growth industry and lots of competitors

1549
01:51:34,380 --> 01:51:39,700
can take different approaches, but the whole pie is growing so much that I don't care if, no,

1550
01:51:39,700 --> 01:51:44,740
you're fighting over a fixed pie here. I'm trading against someone else. I win, they lose.

1551
01:51:45,020 --> 01:51:50,880
Yes. Well, there's one slight nuance to that, but I don't know how much it holds water.

1552
01:51:51,280 --> 01:51:58,200
And the apologist nuance would be, well, Warren Buffett could be on the other side of the trade

1553
01:51:58,200 --> 01:52:05,000
and Medallion could make money on that trade with Warren over its time horizon of a day and a half.

1554
01:52:05,080 --> 01:52:09,660
And Warren could make money over his time horizon of, you know, 50 years.

1555
01:52:10,040 --> 01:52:10,320
Super fair.

1556
01:52:10,320 --> 01:52:14,400
So I think the argument against that, though,

1557
01:52:15,020 --> 01:52:21,520
is that Medallion sold after a day and a half to somebody else who bought at that lower price.

1558
01:52:22,080 --> 01:52:27,120
And so somewhere along the chain, that loss is getting offloaded to somebody.

1559
01:52:27,340 --> 01:52:33,820
The direct counterparty of Medallion and the quant industry writ large might not take the loss,

1560
01:52:33,920 --> 01:52:38,500
but somebody is going to take the loss along the way. It is, as you say, a zero sum game.

1561
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:43,980
Yeah. But I think the important thing is, can you and your adversary both benefit? And I think

1562
01:52:43,980 --> 01:52:45,000
in this case, you and your adversary both benefit. And I think in this case, you and your adversary

1563
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:48,360
and you and your counterparty, the person you're trading against, yes, you have two different

1564
01:52:48,360 --> 01:52:53,740
objective outcomes. Like, can I get a penny over on Warren Buffett by managing to take him on this

1565
01:52:53,740 --> 01:52:57,000
one trade? Sure. But his strategy is such that that is irrelevant.

1566
01:52:58,060 --> 01:53:04,100
So after the historic performance during the financial crisis, as I alluded to earlier,

1567
01:53:04,660 --> 01:53:11,900
Jim retires at the end of 2009 and Peter and Bob become co-CEOs, co-heads of the firm in 2010.

1568
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:14,900
They take the portfolio.

1569
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:19,640
They take the portfolio size up to $10 billion when they take over. It had been at five for the

1570
01:53:19,640 --> 01:53:27,580
last few years of Jim's tenure. They take it up to 10 and really with no impact, which I assume

1571
01:53:27,580 --> 01:53:31,920
means that rent tech was getting better and the models were getting better because otherwise they

1572
01:53:31,920 --> 01:53:39,320
would have gone to 10 before. Right. They gained confidence that they had enough profitable trades

1573
01:53:39,320 --> 01:53:44,440
they could make that they could raise the capacity without dampening returns. Yes. And perhaps they

1574
01:53:44,440 --> 01:53:47,800
could have done it earlier and they just didn't have the confidence that it would work at larger

1575
01:53:47,800 --> 01:53:53,820
size. But I bet they're very good at knowing how large can our strategy work up to before it starts

1576
01:53:53,820 --> 01:54:01,560
having diminishing returns. Yeah. And importantly, during periods of peak volatility, like say 2020,

1577
01:54:02,380 --> 01:54:08,480
Medallion continues to shoot the lights out. So from at least the data that we were able to find

1578
01:54:08,480 --> 01:54:14,160
on Medallion's performance over the past few years, 2020, they were up 149%.

1579
01:54:14,440 --> 01:54:25,640
Gross and 76% net. So the magic is still there. And one way to look at it, which may not be the be-all

1580
01:54:25,640 --> 01:54:32,600
and end-all, but I think is a good way to compare Jim's era at Medallion versus Peter and Bob's era

1581
01:54:32,600 --> 01:54:41,760
during Jim's tenure, Medallion's total aggregate IRR from 1988 when the fund was formed to 2009

1582
01:54:41,760 --> 01:54:42,560
when he retired.

1583
01:54:44,440 --> 01:54:54,640
0.5% gross annual returns and 40.1% net annual returns, which of course did include many periods

1584
01:54:54,640 --> 01:55:02,920
of lower carry, 20% versus the 44%. During the post-Jim era, the Peter and Bob era from 2010

1585
01:55:02,920 --> 01:55:14,160
to 2022 was when we were able to get the latest data. IRRs are 77.3% gross and 40.3%

1586
01:55:14,440 --> 01:55:22,680
net. So better on both fronts, even with much higher average fees. So yeah, I think Medallion is

1587
01:55:22,680 --> 01:55:23,280
doing fine.

1588
01:55:23,900 --> 01:55:28,260
That's amazing. And we weren't able to tell, there's some sources that report that they've

1589
01:55:28,260 --> 01:55:33,940
grown from $10 billion in the last few years to being comfortable at a $15 billion fund size.

1590
01:55:34,400 --> 01:55:39,480
And if so, that just means that they continue to find more profitable strategies within Medallion

1591
01:55:39,480 --> 01:55:42,840
to keep those same unbelievable returns at larger sizes.

1592
01:55:43,280 --> 01:55:43,760
Yeah.

1593
01:55:44,440 --> 01:55:50,800
Ben, at the end of the day, this is all just insane. So as far as we can tell, Ben, you alluded

1594
01:55:50,800 --> 01:55:56,340
to this a bit at the beginning of the episode. And as far as anybody else can tell, Medallion

1595
01:55:56,340 --> 01:56:03,480
has by far the best investing track record of any single investment vehicle in history.

1596
01:56:03,740 --> 01:56:05,180
So give me those net numbers.

1597
01:56:05,180 --> 01:56:14,180
So during the entire lifetime so far of Medallion from 1988 to 2022, that's 34 years,

1598
01:56:14,440 --> 01:56:26,340
the total net annual return number is 40%, 4-0, over 34 years after fees. It's 68%

1599
01:56:26,340 --> 01:56:33,520
before fees, which equates to total lifetime carry dollars for the whole firm

1600
01:56:33,520 --> 01:56:37,140
of $60 billion, just in carry by our calculations.

1601
01:56:37,920 --> 01:56:38,220
Astonishing.

1602
01:56:38,420 --> 01:56:41,120
That is a lot of money.

1603
01:56:41,320 --> 01:56:43,760
Also, David Rosenthal, good spreadsheet work on this.

1604
01:56:43,960 --> 01:56:44,320
You have not done...

1605
01:56:44,440 --> 01:56:48,060
I haven't done a spreadsheet for an episode in a while, so I admire your work on this one.

1606
01:56:48,380 --> 01:56:57,320
Yeah. I still know how to use Excel. Barely. It's going to be a dying art now with Copilot and

1607
01:56:57,320 --> 01:56:58,160
GPTs.

1608
01:56:58,520 --> 01:57:01,820
That's right. Okay, so $60 billion in total carry.

1609
01:57:02,140 --> 01:57:09,240
So $60 billion in total carry is a lot of money. And, well, speaking of a lot of money,

1610
01:57:10,040 --> 01:57:13,280
we do need to mention before we finish the story here,

1611
01:57:13,280 --> 01:57:20,900
that that Rentech money has bought a lot of influence in society. So Bob Mercer,

1612
01:57:21,260 --> 01:57:27,760
that name may have sounded familiar to many of you along the way, Bob was the primary funder

1613
01:57:27,760 --> 01:57:34,320
of Breitbart and Cambridge Analytica, and one of the major financial backers of both the 2016 Trump

1614
01:57:34,320 --> 01:57:41,940
campaign and the Brexit campaign in Great Britain. Now, lest you think that Rentech dollars are

1615
01:57:41,940 --> 01:57:43,260
solely being funneled into the market, I'm not going to go into that. I'm going to go into the

1616
01:57:43,260 --> 01:57:50,100
one side of the political spectrum. Jim Simons is a major Democratic donor, as are many other folks

1617
01:57:50,100 --> 01:57:50,940
at Rentech.

1618
01:57:51,280 --> 01:57:57,220
Yeah. Henry Laufer and other folks are also huge donors, approximately to the same tune as what

1619
01:57:57,220 --> 01:57:58,380
Bob Mercer is on the right.

1620
01:57:58,900 --> 01:58:04,200
Yeah. Tens of millions of dollars, many tens of millions of dollars on all sides and through many

1621
01:58:04,200 --> 01:58:11,640
campaign cycles here from Rentech employees and alumni. This did become a flashpoint for the firm

1622
01:58:11,640 --> 01:58:13,220
in the wake of the 2016 election.

1623
01:58:13,260 --> 01:58:20,540
Mercer obviously became a controversial figure, both externally and internally within the firm.

1624
01:58:21,360 --> 01:58:24,940
Especially once people realized he was the through line through Breitbart,

1625
01:58:25,100 --> 01:58:27,820
Cambridge Analytica, the Trump election, and Brexit.

1626
01:58:28,420 --> 01:58:36,520
Yes. Ultimately, Jim asked Bob to step down as co-CEO in 2017, which he did, but he did remain

1627
01:58:36,520 --> 01:58:41,660
a scientist at the firm and a contributor to the models, even though he wasn't leading the

1628
01:58:41,660 --> 01:58:43,240
organization with Peter from the beginning.

1629
01:58:43,260 --> 01:58:51,680
Ultimately, the thing that surprised me the most is how these people all still work together, despite

1630
01:58:51,680 --> 01:58:56,020
having about the most opposite political beliefs you could possibly have.

1631
01:58:56,280 --> 01:58:58,240
Yeah. Understatement of the century.

1632
01:58:58,240 --> 01:59:05,720
And all being extremely influential and active in those political systems. Yes, Bob Mercer is no

1633
01:59:05,720 --> 01:59:11,820
longer the CEO of Renaissance Technologies or the co-CEO. He still works there. He's still associated.

1634
01:59:12,280 --> 01:59:13,240
They all still speak high-profile.

1635
01:59:13,260 --> 01:59:14,640
They all speak highly of each other. It's unexpected.

1636
01:59:15,440 --> 01:59:18,460
Yeah. I think unexpected is the best way to put it.

1637
01:59:19,040 --> 01:59:22,780
Like everything with Renaissance, it works a little bit different than the rest of the world.

1638
01:59:23,540 --> 01:59:32,480
Yes. Okay. Speaking of, let's transition to analysis. And I have a fun little monologue

1639
01:59:32,480 --> 01:59:38,440
I want to go on, if you will bear with me, Ben. I think this qualifies as the Rentech playbook,

1640
01:59:38,440 --> 01:59:42,420
but I really kind of think of it as the Rentech tapestry.

1641
01:59:42,620 --> 01:59:43,120
Ooh.

1642
01:59:43,120 --> 01:59:46,380
I was inspired by Costco here because we were talking to folks in the research and

1643
01:59:46,380 --> 01:59:52,620
everybody said, you know, Rentech, it just has these puzzle pieces that fit together.

1644
01:59:53,000 --> 02:00:01,020
On the surface, Rentech does the same things that Citadel, D. Shaw, Two Sigma,

1645
02:00:01,880 --> 02:00:06,260
Jane Street, others, et cetera, do. They hire the smartest people in the world

1646
02:00:06,260 --> 02:00:12,800
and they give them the best data and infrastructure in the world to work on. And they say,

1647
02:00:13,120 --> 02:00:20,020
go to town and make profitable trades. Those are very expensive commodities, those two things,

1648
02:00:20,080 --> 02:00:24,140
the smartest people in the world and the best data and infrastructure, but they are commodities.

1649
02:00:24,140 --> 02:00:29,680
Like Citadel can say the exact same things, just the same as like Walmart and Amazon can say,

1650
02:00:29,880 --> 02:00:33,980
we too have large-scale supplier relationships that we leverage to provide low prices to

1651
02:00:33,980 --> 02:00:39,360
customers, just like Costco. But it's underneath that where I think the magic lies. There are three

1652
02:00:39,360 --> 02:00:42,920
very interrelated things that make Rentech,

1653
02:00:43,120 --> 02:00:50,680
unique. So number one, they get the smartest people in the world to collaborate and not

1654
02:00:50,680 --> 02:00:59,480
compete. Pretty much every other financial firm out there, employees and teams within the firm

1655
02:00:59,480 --> 02:01:06,000
quasi-compete with one another. Yeah. I mean, typically in kind of a friendly way, but yeah.

1656
02:01:06,680 --> 02:01:11,800
Let's take like in a venture firm, you've got your lead partner on a deal or a deal team.

1657
02:01:11,960 --> 02:01:13,080
They're working that.

1658
02:01:13,120 --> 02:01:18,700
Deal. And maybe some of the other partners help a little bit, but mostly they're off prosecuting

1659
02:01:18,700 --> 02:01:23,640
their own deals. Yep. And I think that's the most collegial way that this happens in finance.

1660
02:01:23,640 --> 02:01:28,200
Then you've got multi-strategy hedge funds out there where literally firms are being pitted

1661
02:01:28,200 --> 02:01:33,140
against one another to be weighted in the ultimate trading model for the firm. Yep.

1662
02:01:33,620 --> 02:01:41,160
At Rentech though, because of the one model architecture, everyone works together on the same

1663
02:01:41,160 --> 02:01:42,640
investment strategy.

1664
02:01:43,120 --> 02:01:48,780
And the same investment infrastructure. That means everyone sees everybody else's work.

1665
02:01:49,140 --> 02:01:52,360
Everybody who works at Rentech on the research team, on the infrastructure team,

1666
02:01:52,520 --> 02:01:57,420
they have access to the whole model. That's not true anywhere else.

1667
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,840
Yeah, that's a good point. The whole code base is completely visible.

1668
02:02:01,480 --> 02:02:09,180
And that also means because it's just one model, just one strategy, when somebody else improves

1669
02:02:09,180 --> 02:02:13,100
that model's performance, that directly impacts you.

1670
02:02:13,120 --> 02:02:19,000
As much as it impacts them. This is really different than any other hedge fund out there.

1671
02:02:19,560 --> 02:02:23,320
So why is that different than if I roll some of my compensation into a multi-strategy hedge fund

1672
02:02:23,320 --> 02:02:27,260
that I work at? Don't I love other teams creating high performance also?

1673
02:02:27,880 --> 02:02:32,880
Sure, but you don't love it as much as your team because either compensation or career-wise,

1674
02:02:33,240 --> 02:02:38,400
you are much more dependent on your performance than you are other people's performance.

1675
02:02:38,640 --> 02:02:42,820
Oh, yes. This is a big thing. You intend to have a job,

1676
02:02:43,120 --> 02:02:46,860
after that job, at most places, most of the time. So you care about credit,

1677
02:02:47,200 --> 02:02:51,160
and you care about smashing the pinata and then going elsewhere, or building reputation

1678
02:02:51,160 --> 02:02:54,540
and then going elsewhere. Most of the people at Rentech are not going to have another job.

1679
02:02:55,260 --> 02:03:00,680
What did you find on LinkedIn? At least the median tenure of employees is like 16 years.

1680
02:03:01,060 --> 02:03:05,100
Yeah, I just got LinkedIn Premium, and you can see median tenure. And it's crazy. There's only

1681
02:03:05,100 --> 02:03:10,320
like 300, 400 employees at Renaissance, and the median tenure, at least as reported by LinkedIn,

1682
02:03:10,320 --> 02:03:12,820
is like 14 years. Yes.

1683
02:03:13,120 --> 02:03:19,540
Okay, this brings me to point number two, which you said, this is an absurdly small team.

1684
02:03:19,720 --> 02:03:26,580
There are less than 400 employees that work at Rentech, only half of which work in research and

1685
02:03:26,580 --> 02:03:31,680
engineering, and the other half are either back office or institutional sales for the open funds.

1686
02:03:31,820 --> 02:03:37,860
So let's call it, I don't know, 150, 200 people max who are like hands on the wheel here for

1687
02:03:37,860 --> 02:03:39,140
Medallion. Yep.

1688
02:03:39,800 --> 02:03:42,900
Every other peer firm of Rentech,

1689
02:03:43,120 --> 02:03:49,980
Citadel, D, Shaw, Two Sigma, et cetera, all of them, you lump Jane Street, jump the high

1690
02:03:49,980 --> 02:03:54,500
frequency guys in here. Minimum, 2,000 to 5,000 people work at those places.

1691
02:03:55,040 --> 02:03:56,560
Wow, I didn't realize it was that big.

1692
02:03:56,940 --> 02:04:02,960
It is an order of magnitude more people who are working at the other firms versus who are working

1693
02:04:02,960 --> 02:04:08,740
at Rentech. And lest you think that it's like a capital-based thing, no, the institutional funds

1694
02:04:08,740 --> 02:04:13,000
have gotten big. They peaked at over a hundred billion, but they're currently between 60 and 70

1695
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:13,100
billion. And that's a lot of people. And that's a lot of people. And that's a lot of people. And that's a lot of people.

1696
02:04:13,120 --> 02:04:16,460
They peaked at over a hundred billion that they manage on top of the 10 or 15 that's in the

1697
02:04:16,460 --> 02:04:23,780
Medallion fund. Yeah. So AUM is like the same as these big funds. This has all sorts of benefits.

1698
02:04:24,360 --> 02:04:29,600
Number one, there's like the Hermes Atelier workshop benefit. Everyone knows each other by

1699
02:04:29,600 --> 02:04:33,120
name. You know, your colleagues' kids, you know, your colleagues' families.

1700
02:04:33,580 --> 02:04:38,040
Yep. They put right on their website, there are 90 PhDs in mathematics, physics, computer science,

1701
02:04:38,040 --> 02:04:42,680
and related fields. The about page has these 10 kind of random bullet points, and that's one of

1702
02:04:42,680 --> 02:04:42,820
them.

1703
02:04:43,120 --> 02:04:48,700
Yes. Then there's the related aspect to all this. The firm is in the middle of nowhere on Long

1704
02:04:48,700 --> 02:04:54,300
Island. You actually know your colleagues' families and kids because you're not going out and getting

1705
02:04:54,300 --> 02:04:59,520
drinks with someone from Two Sigma in New York City. You're not comparing notes or measuring

1706
02:04:59,520 --> 02:05:03,000
parts of your anatomy with someone else. You're like hanging out at the swimming pool.

1707
02:05:03,740 --> 02:05:07,200
Totally. And since Renaissance doesn't recruit from finance jobs,

1708
02:05:07,940 --> 02:05:13,080
it's kind of unlikely that you know someone else in finance. You came out of a science-related

1709
02:05:13,080 --> 02:05:18,760
field. You now work in East Setauket, Long Island, which has, it's like 10,000 people or something

1710
02:05:18,760 --> 02:05:23,240
or less that live there. So you're in this little town. You're not actually going into the city that

1711
02:05:23,240 --> 02:05:28,860
often. And if you are, it's, again, not to grab drinks with other finance people. So even if you

1712
02:05:28,860 --> 02:05:37,740
didn't have a many-page non-compete and a lifetime NDA, you're very unlikely to be in the social

1713
02:05:37,740 --> 02:05:42,720
circles. You're just not getting exposed. Exactly. And Rentex Hiring,

1714
02:05:43,080 --> 02:05:47,680
established scientists and PhDs, they're not hiring kids out of undergrad like

1715
02:05:47,680 --> 02:05:53,020
Jane Street or Bridgewater is. My sense is that the place is like a college campus without any

1716
02:05:53,020 --> 02:05:57,700
students. Have you seen the pictures online? Yeah. If you look up Renaissance Technologies

1717
02:05:57,700 --> 02:06:02,820
at Google and you go and look at the photos on campus, it's a little courtyard and winding

1718
02:06:02,820 --> 02:06:10,440
walking path and woods all around it, tennis courts. Yep. So then there's the last piece of

1719
02:06:10,440 --> 02:06:13,060
the small team element, which is just the magnitude.

1720
02:06:13,080 --> 02:06:18,860
of the financial impact, which I don't think is true. But let's say that there were another

1721
02:06:18,860 --> 02:06:25,780
quant fund that made the same number of dollars of performance returns that Rentex does. At Rentex,

1722
02:06:25,820 --> 02:06:30,280
you're splitting that a couple hundred ways. At Citadel, you're splitting that 5,000 ways.

1723
02:06:30,920 --> 02:06:35,880
It just doesn't make sense to go anywhere else. We were chatting with someone to prep for this

1724
02:06:35,880 --> 02:06:39,740
episode and they told us, you can't ever compete with them, but they'll pay you enough that you

1725
02:06:39,740 --> 02:06:42,240
won't want to. Yes. Okay.

1726
02:06:43,080 --> 02:06:46,320
This brings me to what I've been kind of teasing and I'm super excited about.

1727
02:06:46,320 --> 02:06:53,600
I think the third puzzle piece of what makes Rentex so unique and defensible

1728
02:06:53,600 --> 02:07:06,740
is Medallion's structure itself. That it is a LPGP fund with 5% management fee and 44% carry.

1729
02:07:07,440 --> 02:07:12,920
So it's not like a prop shop or like proprietary, it's just one pot of money. It's literally a

1730
02:07:12,920 --> 02:07:16,360
GPLP, even though the GPs and the LPs are the same people.

1731
02:07:16,960 --> 02:07:21,140
So here's my thinking on this. Now, I don't know how it is actually structured, but

1732
02:07:21,140 --> 02:07:27,740
there was something about this whole crazy 44% carry that just wasn't sitting with me right

1733
02:07:27,740 --> 02:07:31,160
throughout the research because I kept asking myself, why?

1734
02:07:31,620 --> 02:07:35,860
Right. They've already kicked out most of the LPs, if not all. So why are they raising the carry?

1735
02:07:36,260 --> 02:07:42,900
Right. It's all themselves. It's all insiders. Why do they charge themselves 44% carry and 5%

1736
02:07:42,920 --> 02:07:47,180
management fees? I think Jim talks about this though. Oh, I pay the fees just like everybody

1737
02:07:47,180 --> 02:07:50,500
else. Yes. It's always a funny argument. It's like, who are you paying the fees to?

1738
02:07:50,940 --> 02:07:58,640
Right. So I was like, what is happening here? So, okay, here's my hypothesis. This is not about

1739
02:07:58,640 --> 02:08:03,740
having crazy performance fees. This is not about having the highest carry in the industry.

1740
02:08:05,120 --> 02:08:11,980
This is a value transfer mechanism within the firm from the tenure base,

1741
02:08:12,260 --> 02:08:12,900
to the company, to the company, to the company, to the company.

1742
02:08:12,920 --> 02:08:17,780
People who are working on Medallion in any given year. So here's how I think it works.

1743
02:08:18,440 --> 02:08:25,140
When people come into Rentech, they obviously have way less wealth than the people who've been there

1744
02:08:25,140 --> 02:08:30,460
for a long time, both from the direct returns that you're getting every year from working there

1745
02:08:30,460 --> 02:08:37,360
and just your investment percentage of the Medallion fund, which by the way, I think they

1746
02:08:37,360 --> 02:08:42,900
took, it was either the state of New York or the federal government to court to be able to

1747
02:08:42,920 --> 02:08:49,880
have the 401k plan at Rentech be the Medallion fund. No way. Yeah. So like if you work there,

1748
02:08:49,980 --> 02:08:54,740
your 401k is the Medallion fund. That's crazy. So it really doesn't take more than a few years

1749
02:08:54,740 --> 02:08:58,780
before you're set for life. Totally. I mean, depending on your definition of set for life,

1750
02:08:58,840 --> 02:09:05,260
I think it happens very, very quickly. Yep. Okay. So given that though, how do you avoid

1751
02:09:05,260 --> 02:09:10,680
the incentive for a group of talented younger folks to split off and go start their own

1752
02:09:10,680 --> 02:09:12,620
Medallion fund? Right.

1753
02:09:12,920 --> 02:09:17,660
Especially when they all have access to the whole code base. The whole thing is meant to

1754
02:09:17,660 --> 02:09:22,920
function like a university math department where everyone's constantly knowledge sharing because

1755
02:09:22,920 --> 02:09:26,520
we're going to create better peer-reviewed research when we all share all the knowledge

1756
02:09:26,520 --> 02:09:31,120
all the time. You would think that's a super risky thing to give everyone all the keys.

1757
02:09:31,700 --> 02:09:37,820
Right. So I think it's the 44% carry structure that does it. Because basically what you're

1758
02:09:37,820 --> 02:09:42,560
saying is every year, 5% management fee.

1759
02:09:42,920 --> 02:09:48,980
So 5% off the top and then 44% of performance. So let's say Medallion is on the order of,

1760
02:09:49,120 --> 02:09:52,580
call it doubling every year. Let's round that up and just add them and say

1761
02:09:52,580 --> 02:10:02,400
49% of the economic returns in any given year go to the current team and 51% of the economic returns

1762
02:10:02,400 --> 02:10:07,380
go to the tenure base. I was like, what is the equivalent here? I think it's kind of

1763
02:10:07,380 --> 02:10:11,720
like a academic tenure kind of thing. The longer tenure you are at the firm,

1764
02:10:11,880 --> 02:10:12,900
the more you're better at it. So it's like, what is the equivalent here?

1765
02:10:12,900 --> 02:10:18,700
The balance shifts to the LP side of things. And the younger you are at the firm,

1766
02:10:18,700 --> 02:10:24,620
the more your balance is on the GP side of things. But at the end of the day, it's 51-49.

1767
02:10:25,140 --> 02:10:30,860
So there's this very natural value transfer mechanism to keep the people that are working

1768
02:10:30,860 --> 02:10:38,400
in any given year super incentivized. And as you stay there longer, you are paying

1769
02:10:38,400 --> 02:10:41,100
your younger colleagues to work for you.

1770
02:10:41,420 --> 02:10:42,060
Right.

1771
02:10:42,900 --> 02:10:46,720
It's funny. I think it's a good insight that it's structured like a university department tenure.

1772
02:10:47,160 --> 02:10:53,440
Well, I just kept asking myself, why? Why? Why do they have this if there's no outside LPs? And this

1773
02:10:53,440 --> 02:10:58,740
was the best thing I could come up with. And I actually think it's kind of genius.

1774
02:10:59,020 --> 02:11:03,120
Yeah. It's more elegant than it's all one person's money and they're deciding to bonus

1775
02:11:03,120 --> 02:11:07,120
out the current team every year and just give them enough money to make sure you retain them.

1776
02:11:07,480 --> 02:11:11,480
Right. Which is how I think most prop shops work. Like Jane Street is mostly a prop shop.

1777
02:11:11,480 --> 02:11:12,600
I think it is mostly...

1778
02:11:12,900 --> 02:11:17,060
The principal's money. But that's a static situation. It's not like,

1779
02:11:17,540 --> 02:11:20,880
you know, if that were true, then Jim would just own this thing forever.

1780
02:11:21,720 --> 02:11:23,900
And I don't think that's true here at Rentech.

1781
02:11:24,220 --> 02:11:30,240
Yeah. So essentially, David, the real magic is they've got one fund. It's evergreen. And

1782
02:11:30,240 --> 02:11:35,720
when you start at the firm, you're only getting sort of paid the carry amount. But over time,

1783
02:11:36,020 --> 02:11:42,000
you become a meaningful investor in the firm and you sort of shift to that 51%. You're kind of the

1784
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:42,280
LP.

1785
02:11:42,900 --> 02:11:46,720
And then over time, you eventually graduate out entirely and you're only an LP. And so you're

1786
02:11:46,720 --> 02:11:52,760
right. It's a value transfer mechanism from the old guard to the new guard in a way that is clear,

1787
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:58,160
well understood, probably tax advantaged versus just doing, I'm the owner and I'm giving everyone

1788
02:11:58,160 --> 02:11:58,980
arbitrary bonuses.

1789
02:11:59,580 --> 02:12:05,900
Yeah. And at the end of the day, I think these three pieces, to me, are the core of this sort

1790
02:12:05,900 --> 02:12:12,880
of tapestry of Rentech. One model that everybody collaborates on together, a super small team,

1791
02:12:12,900 --> 02:12:18,860
where we all know each other and the financial impact that any of us make to that one model is

1792
02:12:18,860 --> 02:12:27,800
great to all of us. And three, this LPGP model with very high carry performance fees that creates

1793
02:12:27,800 --> 02:12:32,160
the right set of incentives, both for new talent on the way in and old talent on the way out.

1794
02:12:32,820 --> 02:12:37,280
Yep. I think that's right. Okay. There's a few other parts of the story that we skipped along

1795
02:12:37,280 --> 02:12:42,480
the way because there was no real good place to put them in. But these are objectively fascinating

1796
02:12:42,480 --> 02:12:42,880
historical pieces. And I think that's a really good way to put them in. And I think that's a really

1797
02:12:42,880 --> 02:12:47,620
historical events that are totally worth knowing about. And the first one is called basket options.

1798
02:12:48,180 --> 02:12:56,640
So the year is 2002. Rentech has 13 years of knowing that they basically have a machine that

1799
02:12:56,640 --> 02:13:02,520
prints money. So what should you do when you have a machine that prints money? Leverage. Now, there

1800
02:13:02,520 --> 02:13:07,060
are all sorts of restrictions around firms like this and how much leverage they can take on. You

1801
02:13:07,060 --> 02:13:12,360
can't just go and say, I'm going to borrow $100 for every dollar of equity capital that I have in

1802
02:13:12,360 --> 02:13:12,560
here.

1803
02:13:12,880 --> 02:13:18,600
So you need to sort of get clever to borrow a whole bunch of money from banks or from any lender

1804
02:13:18,600 --> 02:13:24,140
to basically juice your returns. If, again, you have a money printing machine that's reliable.

1805
02:13:24,660 --> 02:13:28,500
Most people don't. Most people probably shouldn't take leverage because they're just as likely to

1806
02:13:28,500 --> 02:13:33,760
blow the whole thing up as they are to be successful. So basket options. I am going to

1807
02:13:33,760 --> 02:13:37,580
read directly from the man who solved the market because Greg Zuckerman just put it perfectly.

1808
02:13:38,340 --> 02:13:42,460
Basket options are financial instruments whose values are pegged to the performance of a specific

1809
02:13:42,460 --> 02:13:48,180
basket of stocks. While most options are based on an individual stock or a financial instrument,

1810
02:13:48,600 --> 02:13:53,440
basket options are linked to a group of shares. If these underlying stocks rise,

1811
02:13:53,520 --> 02:13:58,080
the value of the option goes up. It's like owning the shares without actually doing so.

1812
02:13:58,540 --> 02:14:02,820
Indeed, the banks who, of course, loaned the money, who put the money in the basket option,

1813
02:14:03,100 --> 02:14:06,740
were legal owners of the shares in the basket. But for all intents and purposes,

1814
02:14:07,120 --> 02:14:11,060
they were Medallion's property. So this is very clever. Medallion's saying, well,

1815
02:14:11,060 --> 02:14:12,240
the way we're going to lever up is,

1816
02:14:12,460 --> 02:14:17,600
there's a basket. We have an option to purchase that basket. Most of the capital in that basket

1817
02:14:17,600 --> 02:14:23,080
is actually the bank's capital. But the bank has hired us to trade the options in the basket. And

1818
02:14:23,080 --> 02:14:30,000
then after a year, when long-term capital gains tax kicks in, we have the option to buy that

1819
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:34,420
basket. So anyway, all day, Medallion's computer sent automated instructions to the banks,

1820
02:14:34,560 --> 02:14:40,040
sometimes in order a minute or even a second. The options gave Medallion the ability to borrow

1821
02:14:40,040 --> 02:14:42,360
significantly more than it otherwise would be allowed.

1822
02:14:42,460 --> 02:14:47,140
Competitors generally had about $7 of financial instruments for every dollar of cash.

1823
02:14:47,500 --> 02:14:52,620
By contrast, Medallion's option strategy allowed it to have $12.50 worth of financial instruments

1824
02:14:52,620 --> 02:14:56,920
for every dollar of cash, making it easier to trounce rivals, assuming they could keep

1825
02:14:56,920 --> 02:15:00,780
finding profitable trades. When Medallion spied an especially juicy opportunity,

1826
02:15:01,080 --> 02:15:06,840
it could boost leverage, holding close to $20 of asset for every dollar of cash. In 2002,

1827
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:11,580
Medallion managed over $5 billion, but it controlled over $60 billion of investment positions.

1828
02:15:12,300 --> 02:15:12,440
David, thank you so much for joining us.

1829
02:15:12,460 --> 02:15:16,120
This exposes something we haven't shared yet on the episode, which is it's not just that they

1830
02:15:16,120 --> 02:15:22,020
could find $5 billion worth of profitable trades. It's that they wanted to lever the crap out of

1831
02:15:22,020 --> 02:15:28,060
$5 billion and find $60 billion of profitable trades to make. And basket options gave them

1832
02:15:28,060 --> 02:15:33,000
a legal way to have an incredible amount of leverage in a way that they felt safe about.

1833
02:15:33,540 --> 02:15:40,460
Yeah, the unlevered returns if you were running this strategy would be much lower.

1834
02:15:40,580 --> 02:15:42,400
Yeah. So a big piece of this playbook,

1835
02:15:42,400 --> 02:15:45,680
we didn't talk about is leverage, but every quant fund does leverage. And so

1836
02:15:45,680 --> 02:15:47,920
Renaissance was just more clever than everyone else.

1837
02:15:48,460 --> 02:15:54,160
Yeah. It's an important point, though. Nine out of every 10 companies that we cover on Acquired,

1838
02:15:54,780 --> 02:15:56,680
leverage is zero part of the story.

1839
02:15:56,900 --> 02:15:57,020
Right.

1840
02:15:57,340 --> 02:16:00,560
And for us coming from the world we come from in tech and venture capital,

1841
02:16:01,080 --> 02:16:03,280
leverage is like a dirty word. Like, I'm scared of it.

1842
02:16:03,760 --> 02:16:08,100
Right. I mean, you could imagine, let's say it wasn't, they were right 50.25% of the time,

1843
02:16:08,100 --> 02:16:11,940
but they were right 50.0001% of the time. They would need to do

1844
02:16:11,940 --> 02:16:18,660
a ton of trades in order to generate enough profits. So that's why you need $60 billion of

1845
02:16:18,660 --> 02:16:24,900
cash to actually execute the strategy to produce the returns that they were looking for on $5

1846
02:16:24,900 --> 02:16:29,580
billion of equity. Anyway, there's a second chapter to this, which is it's all well and

1847
02:16:29,580 --> 02:16:34,200
good that this is how they get a bunch of leverage. That's one piece of it. The other piece is they

1848
02:16:34,200 --> 02:16:38,460
thought this was a remarkably tax efficient vehicle. The way that they were filing their

1849
02:16:38,460 --> 02:16:41,760
taxes said, oh, sure, there's stuff in that basket.

1850
02:16:41,940 --> 02:16:46,760
But the thing that we actually own is an option to buy that basket or sell that basket. And we

1851
02:16:46,760 --> 02:16:51,600
only exercise that once every 13 months or so. I don't know the exact number, but something like

1852
02:16:51,600 --> 02:16:56,060
that over a year. And so therefore, we're buying something, we're holding it for a year, we're

1853
02:16:56,060 --> 02:17:00,480
selling it. Oh, of course, there's millions and millions of trades going on inside the basket,

1854
02:17:00,600 --> 02:17:05,040
but we don't own that basket. The banks do. We're just advising them. You can kind of see the logic

1855
02:17:05,040 --> 02:17:11,880
here. Over time, eventually in 2021, the IRS said, no, you made all those trades. That was,

1856
02:17:11,940 --> 02:17:19,200
not a completely separate entity. And so you guys owed $6.8 billion in taxes that you didn't pay.

1857
02:17:19,680 --> 02:17:24,440
You're going to need to pay that with interest, with penalties. And by the way, Jim Simons,

1858
02:17:24,600 --> 02:17:28,500
we're going to want you and the other few partners to really bear the load of that.

1859
02:17:28,500 --> 02:17:35,300
And they did. So for Simons alone, he paid $670 million to the IRS in back taxes for this basket

1860
02:17:35,300 --> 02:17:40,360
option strategy that turned out not to be a long-term capital gain. All right. So numbers

1861
02:17:40,360 --> 02:17:41,920
on the business today. And then we'll be back in just a moment.

1862
02:17:41,920 --> 02:17:46,560
We will dive into power and playbook. So today we've talked about Medallion,

1863
02:17:46,800 --> 02:17:50,880
10 or 15 billion, depending on who you ask. Historically, it was more like 5 or 10 billion.

1864
02:17:51,200 --> 02:17:56,940
The institutional fund is about 60 to 70 billion. And at one point was 100 billion.

1865
02:17:57,400 --> 02:18:02,820
The total carry generated, David, you said is $60 billion. Forbes estimates that Jim Simons alone

1866
02:18:02,820 --> 02:18:07,340
is worth about $30 billion today, which kind of pencils with a bunch of other

1867
02:18:07,640 --> 02:18:10,880
stats over the years that he owned about half of Renaissance.

1868
02:18:10,880 --> 02:18:17,640
The returns, obviously, the Medallion fund generated approximately 66% annualized from

1869
02:18:17,640 --> 02:18:26,300
1988 to 2020 after those fees was about 39% wild. So an interesting thing to understand,

1870
02:18:26,720 --> 02:18:32,420
I ran a hypothetical scenario of how much money do you think Renaissance the business makes a year

1871
02:18:32,420 --> 02:18:39,260
in revenue? And so the institutional fund, let's call it 10% on 60 billion of assets. So that's

1872
02:18:39,260 --> 02:18:40,860
$600 million from fees and $600 million from returns. So that's about $60 billion of assets.

1873
02:18:40,880 --> 02:18:48,460
From performance. So 1.2 billion a year in revenue to the firm from the institutional side of the

1874
02:18:48,460 --> 02:18:52,680
business. Because I always ask myself the question, does that actually matter? They did all this work

1875
02:18:52,680 --> 02:18:58,480
to stand up the institutional side. Who cares? Well, let's say Medallion does their average 66%

1876
02:18:58,480 --> 02:19:09,660
gross on 15 billion. That is 750 million in fees and 4.3 billion on performance. So a total of 5

1877
02:19:09,660 --> 02:19:10,760
billion from Medallion.

1878
02:19:10,880 --> 02:19:16,460
And 1.2 billion from the institutional side of the business. Now, of course, the employees are

1879
02:19:16,460 --> 02:19:20,280
the investors in Medallion. So you could just argue it's actually silly to cut them up. But

1880
02:19:20,280 --> 02:19:23,740
I don't know. It's a $7, $8, $9 billion revenue business.

1881
02:19:24,520 --> 02:19:27,720
Right. Because that's not including the LP return on Medallion.

1882
02:19:27,800 --> 02:19:29,120
A hundred percent. It's not.

1883
02:19:29,260 --> 02:19:32,220
Which again, as we spent a long time talking about, it's all the same thing.

1884
02:19:32,440 --> 02:19:36,980
Yes. But it's kind of interesting just to compare it against other companies to have

1885
02:19:36,980 --> 02:19:40,560
this in the back of your head. This is a $7, $8 billion a year revenue business.

1886
02:19:40,880 --> 02:19:44,920
Now, I think there are a lot of expenses on the infrastructure side.

1887
02:19:45,360 --> 02:19:48,080
Totally. That was another thing I wanted to talk about. The fact that they do,

1888
02:19:48,220 --> 02:19:53,880
let's say Medallion alone. So they have $750 million in fees. I don't think they come close

1889
02:19:53,880 --> 02:19:59,560
to $750 million a year in expenses, but they are running who knows what infrastructure,

1890
02:19:59,740 --> 02:20:04,620
some kind of supercomputing cluster. What does it cost to run one Amazon data center? I mean,

1891
02:20:04,660 --> 02:20:06,420
it's, I think, much smaller scale.

1892
02:20:06,740 --> 02:20:10,080
I don't know. I mean, you're talking about a lot of data here.

1893
02:20:10,360 --> 02:20:10,680
Yeah.

1894
02:20:10,880 --> 02:20:17,120
It says right on their website, they have 50,000 computer cores with 150 gigabits per second of

1895
02:20:17,120 --> 02:20:22,380
global connectivity and a research database that grows by more than 40 terabytes a day.

1896
02:20:22,860 --> 02:20:24,000
That's a lot of data.

1897
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:28,720
Right. Is that $750 million a year? I don't know, but it's not zero.

1898
02:20:29,120 --> 02:20:33,320
I don't think so. They're certainly not losing money on the fees,

1899
02:20:33,560 --> 02:20:36,440
but there are actual hard costs to this business.

1900
02:20:36,780 --> 02:20:40,400
Right. I wonder too, if the fee element,

1901
02:20:40,400 --> 02:20:45,860
of Medallion, basically pays the base salaries for the current team.

1902
02:20:46,720 --> 02:20:52,560
That feels like it's right. If you're someone who has done a data center build out before,

1903
02:20:52,780 --> 02:20:58,620
or has any way to sort of back into what the costs of Medallion's operating expenses are on the

1904
02:20:58,620 --> 02:21:03,400
compute and data and network side, we would love to hear from you. Hello at Acquired.fm.

1905
02:21:04,200 --> 02:21:05,100
Okay. Power?

1906
02:21:05,820 --> 02:21:09,040
Power. This is a fun one.

1907
02:21:09,040 --> 02:21:10,340
Yeah. So listeners who are new,

1908
02:21:10,400 --> 02:21:15,820
this is Hamilton Helmer's framework from the book Seven Powers. What is it that enables a business

1909
02:21:15,820 --> 02:21:20,980
to achieve persistent differential returns to be more profitable than their closest competitor on

1910
02:21:20,980 --> 02:21:26,440
a sustainable basis? And the seven are counter-positioning, scale economies, switching

1911
02:21:26,440 --> 02:21:33,140
costs, network economies, process power, branding, and cornered resource. And David,

1912
02:21:33,760 --> 02:21:39,960
my question to you to open this section is specifically about Rentech's lifelong non-competes.

1913
02:21:40,400 --> 02:21:44,800
That feels like a big reason that they maintain their competitive advantage.

1914
02:21:44,980 --> 02:21:48,320
And I'm curious, if you agree with that, what would you put that under?

1915
02:21:48,320 --> 02:21:54,340
Well, I think it's lifelong NDAs and non-competes as long as the state of New York

1916
02:21:54,340 --> 02:21:58,860
legally allows for, but that is not lifetime. I've heard various figures,

1917
02:21:59,280 --> 02:22:04,960
six years, five years, something like that. I mean, at the end of the day, non-competes are more like,

1918
02:22:05,140 --> 02:22:09,820
what is one side willing to go to court over? But the reality is,

1919
02:22:10,400 --> 02:22:14,840
people don't leave. People don't leave, period. And people especially don't leave and start their

1920
02:22:14,840 --> 02:22:21,240
own firms. I was thinking about this in the middle of the night, and I think there's three

1921
02:22:21,240 --> 02:22:30,920
layers to the effective non-compete that happens with Rentech. There's the legal layer, the base

1922
02:22:30,920 --> 02:22:34,520
layer that you're talking about. It's like the agreements you sign. Then there's the economic

1923
02:22:34,520 --> 02:22:40,040
layer of what we spent a long time talking about in Tapestry of, it would just be dumb

1924
02:22:40,400 --> 02:22:45,220
leave. You are better off staying there as part of that team with a smaller number of people

1925
02:22:45,220 --> 02:22:50,640
than going to Sigma with a lot more people. I think that's the next level of, and then I think

1926
02:22:50,640 --> 02:22:55,000
the highest level is just probably the social layer. You're there with the smartest people

1927
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:59,680
in the world in a collegial atmosphere where you're all working hard on something that has

1928
02:22:59,680 --> 02:23:04,320
direct impact on you. Right. It's your community. It's your community. Totally. You're not in New

1929
02:23:04,320 --> 02:23:10,240
York City. You're not in the Hamptons. You're not in Silicon Valley. You are selecting into

1930
02:23:10,240 --> 02:23:17,140
that. I think if that's what you want, what better place in the world? All right. Classify it.

1931
02:23:17,140 --> 02:23:22,520
What power does that fall under? Well, I think the people specifically you would

1932
02:23:22,520 --> 02:23:27,220
put into cornered resource, but I'm not actually sure that fully captures it here.

1933
02:23:27,680 --> 02:23:32,960
I was thinking more process power because I think it is the combination of the people

1934
02:23:32,960 --> 02:23:40,220
and the model and the incentive structures. Yep. I think that's right. I also had my,

1935
02:23:40,240 --> 02:23:45,540
biggest one being process power. You actually can develop intricate knowledge of how a system

1936
02:23:45,540 --> 02:23:50,540
works and then build processes around that that are hard to replicate elsewhere. I think these

1937
02:23:50,540 --> 02:23:55,100
systems have been layered over time also, where anyone who's come into the firm in the last five

1938
02:23:55,100 --> 02:24:02,300
years doesn't know how it works start to finish. I didn't ask anyone to verify that, but it's over

1939
02:24:02,300 --> 02:24:09,600
10 million lines of code. And the level of complexity of the system of when it's putting

1940
02:24:09,600 --> 02:24:14,920
on trades, what trades is putting on, why, the speed at which they need to happen. I actually

1941
02:24:14,920 --> 02:24:20,480
don't think anyone holds the whole model in their head. And so I think there's process power just

1942
02:24:20,480 --> 02:24:27,100
because it's 30 plus years of complexity that's been built up. Yep. I totally agree with that,

1943
02:24:27,360 --> 02:24:32,720
particularly in the model itself. I mean, maybe you could argue the model is a cornered resource.

1944
02:24:33,240 --> 02:24:38,420
I am going to argue that the data is a cornered resource. I don't know for sure about the model.

1945
02:24:38,420 --> 02:24:39,320
Maybe. I mean,

1946
02:24:39,320 --> 02:24:43,580
I guess that's the same thing as saying the knowledge of what the 10 million lines of code

1947
02:24:43,580 --> 02:24:48,860
does. That's the model. But I actually think the fact that they have clean data and they've been

1948
02:24:48,860 --> 02:24:54,840
creating systems, like they have the best PhDs in the world thinking about data cleaning. That's

1949
02:24:54,840 --> 02:25:02,820
not a sexy job. And yet they have probably the treasure trove of historical market data in the

1950
02:25:02,820 --> 02:25:08,960
best format that nobody else has. That's an actual cornered resource. I have a couple nuances on this.

1951
02:25:09,320 --> 02:25:13,940
One, I think it probably is true that they have better data than any other firm,

1952
02:25:14,140 --> 02:25:19,560
thanks to Sandor Strauss and the work that he started doing in the 80s before anybody else

1953
02:25:19,560 --> 02:25:27,540
was really doing this. So they have that and other firms don't. That said, certainly all the

1954
02:25:27,540 --> 02:25:33,820
other quant firms are throwing untold resources at all this too. Right. They want to do this

1955
02:25:33,820 --> 02:25:38,620
and money is not the issue. So in chatting with a few folks

1956
02:25:38,620 --> 02:25:47,080
about this episode, I had more than one person say to me, there's two ways that rent tech could

1957
02:25:47,080 --> 02:25:55,320
work. And one version of how it works is they discovered something 20 plus years ago that is

1958
02:25:55,320 --> 02:26:00,140
a timeless secret and they've been trading on that for 20 plus years. Right. There's one particular

1959
02:26:00,140 --> 02:26:04,380
relationship between types of equities that they've just been exploiting and no one can figure out

1960
02:26:04,380 --> 02:26:08,540
except them. Right. And that may entirely be possible. Isn't that crazy?

1961
02:26:08,620 --> 02:26:12,880
Right. Now rent tech will say, they will all say that is a hundred percent, not the way that it

1962
02:26:12,880 --> 02:26:17,260
works. It's not that at all. If that were the way that it works, they would of course still say that

1963
02:26:17,260 --> 02:26:21,200
because they don't want anybody to know. Right. Don't look at the relationship between soybean

1964
02:26:21,200 --> 02:26:28,200
futures and GM. Just don't do it. Right. So let's accept that there is a possibility that that might

1965
02:26:28,200 --> 02:26:36,040
be true. More likely though, is that what rent tech does say is true, which is no, there is no

1966
02:26:36,040 --> 02:26:42,140
holy grail. What we do here is we completely reinvent the whole system continuously on a

1967
02:26:42,140 --> 02:26:49,440
two-year cycle. Two years is kind of what I heard that the model is fully restructured every two

1968
02:26:49,440 --> 02:26:54,200
years. It's not like on a date every two years, it's being restructured every day, but collectively

1969
02:26:54,200 --> 02:26:58,400
it's about a two-year cycle. So that would be an argument then that the people actually could,

1970
02:26:58,720 --> 02:27:03,160
with five people left, they probably could go recreate it and all they would need is the data.

1971
02:27:03,460 --> 02:27:05,840
It's also an argument that there is no actual,

1972
02:27:06,040 --> 02:27:09,900
cornered resource here in terms of either the model itself and maybe not the data either.

1973
02:27:10,660 --> 02:27:14,280
I bet the data is though. Let's say you've been working there for 10 years.

1974
02:27:14,620 --> 02:27:21,360
You don't know how the 1955 soybean futures data ended up in the database. Even if you're used to

1975
02:27:21,360 --> 02:27:25,600
using that data and you're able to go recreate the model elsewhere, you don't know how it

1976
02:27:25,600 --> 02:27:30,060
originally found its way in. I think that's fair. I think there

1977
02:27:30,060 --> 02:27:36,020
might also be some argument to the data that that older data is helpful, but its value decays,

1978
02:27:36,040 --> 02:27:42,040
as markets evolve. The broader point I want to make here is just that every other major

1979
02:27:42,040 --> 02:27:45,960
quant firm out there is also spending hundreds of millions, if not billions on this stuff too.

1980
02:27:46,560 --> 02:27:50,600
And people are looking for alt data everywhere. The Bridgewaters of the world are paying gobs of

1981
02:27:50,600 --> 02:27:55,640
money for things that you would never dream could possibly have an effect on the stock market. And

1982
02:27:55,640 --> 02:27:59,040
yet they're paying millions or tens of millions or hundreds of millions of dollars for it.

1983
02:27:59,440 --> 02:28:04,500
Yep. So I think we can rule out scale economies for sure. If anything,

1984
02:28:04,500 --> 02:28:06,000
they're anti-scale economies.

1985
02:28:06,040 --> 02:28:12,160
Oh, yes. Totally. There's dis-economies of scale. Your strategies stop working when you get too much

1986
02:28:12,160 --> 02:28:12,580
AUM.

1987
02:28:13,040 --> 02:28:18,020
Yep. You get slippage. I don't think there's any network economies here. I mean, they literally

1988
02:28:18,020 --> 02:28:19,140
don't talk to anybody.

1989
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:28,160
Although, well, they do have some very well-established relationships with electronic

1990
02:28:28,160 --> 02:28:32,940
brokerages and different players in the trade execution chain. I think they have very good

1991
02:28:32,940 --> 02:28:35,940
trade execution and very fast marketability.

1992
02:28:36,040 --> 02:28:36,540
Yeah. I mean, I think they have very good trade execution and very fast marketability.

1993
02:28:36,540 --> 02:28:39,620
Their ability to pull data out of the market is very high quality.

1994
02:28:39,960 --> 02:28:42,180
Do you think it's actually better than their competitors though?

1995
02:28:42,340 --> 02:28:44,140
I don't know. That's probably not the secret sauce.

1996
02:28:44,340 --> 02:28:45,320
Yeah. I don't think so.

1997
02:28:45,700 --> 02:28:46,660
It's the table stakes.

1998
02:28:47,020 --> 02:28:51,860
Switching costs I don't think apply. Branding maybe applies in their ability to raise money

1999
02:28:51,860 --> 02:28:54,640
for the institutional funds, but that's not a big part of the business.

2000
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:58,600
The fee stream on the institutional fund may entirely belong to branding.

2001
02:28:59,100 --> 02:28:59,420
Yes.

2002
02:28:59,840 --> 02:29:03,800
But I think there's a lot of public equity firms and a lot of hedge funds that have a lot of

2003
02:29:03,800 --> 02:29:06,020
branding power that have, on average, a lot of money. And I think that's a big part of the

2004
02:29:06,040 --> 02:29:11,640
market returns with decent sharp ratios and are able to raise because they've built a brand.

2005
02:29:12,080 --> 02:29:12,200
Yep.

2006
02:29:12,600 --> 02:29:13,780
Venture firms the same way.

2007
02:29:14,120 --> 02:29:18,460
Totally. So for me, this kind of leaves counter-positioning. I actually think there's

2008
02:29:18,460 --> 02:29:21,880
some counter-positioning here, and I think we're going to have two episodes in a row

2009
02:29:21,880 --> 02:29:23,680
of counter-positioning at scale.

2010
02:29:24,100 --> 02:29:27,580
Tell me about your counter-positioning. Who is being counter-positioned in what way?

2011
02:29:28,340 --> 02:29:32,440
They're direct competitors in the market, the other quant firms. And when I say direct

2012
02:29:32,440 --> 02:29:35,380
competitors, I obviously don't mean for LP dollars. I mean for like

2013
02:29:35,380 --> 02:29:35,980
the same amount of money that's being put into the market.

2014
02:29:35,980 --> 02:29:36,020
So they're not going to be able to raise money.

2015
02:29:36,020 --> 02:29:37,760
They're not going to be able to raise money for the same type of trading activity.

2016
02:29:38,220 --> 02:29:39,620
Like they're counterparties in trades.

2017
02:29:40,120 --> 02:29:44,480
I don't think they are counterparties. I think they are all seeking to exploit

2018
02:29:44,480 --> 02:29:47,960
similar types of trades. I think the counterparties are the people there,

2019
02:29:48,220 --> 02:29:49,960
the dentists that they're taking advantage of.

2020
02:29:50,120 --> 02:29:52,620
Well, but quant funds are often counterparties to each other.

2021
02:29:52,940 --> 02:29:58,680
That's true. But I think, yes, adversaries in finding the similar types of trades. And I think

2022
02:29:58,680 --> 02:30:05,780
the counter-positioning for Rentech, or for Medallion specifically, is one,

2023
02:30:05,780 --> 02:30:10,960
and I do think the single model approach versus the multi-model, multi-strategy approach that

2024
02:30:10,960 --> 02:30:14,660
most others have, does have benefits like I was talking about in the tapestries.

2025
02:30:14,660 --> 02:30:22,400
But I think also, and maybe bigger, is every incentive at Rentech is fully aligned

2026
02:30:22,400 --> 02:30:29,660
to optimize fund size for performance in a way that is not true just about everywhere else.

2027
02:30:30,380 --> 02:30:35,720
I think they have the most incentive of anybody to truly maximize,

2028
02:30:35,720 --> 02:30:37,820
maximize performance we're able to achieve.

2029
02:30:38,400 --> 02:30:43,240
Right. Even though the dollars would continue to rise because they get fee dollars from more

2030
02:30:43,240 --> 02:30:49,420
money in the door, they are incentivized in a unique way that makes it so they're not willing

2031
02:30:49,420 --> 02:30:53,940
to trade the dampener on performance to get those dollars.

2032
02:30:54,560 --> 02:31:00,460
Yes. Particularly because it's all the same people on the GP and LP side.

2033
02:31:00,560 --> 02:31:04,980
Oh, we keep going round and round that axle. I loosely buy the counter-positioning thing.

2034
02:31:05,200 --> 02:31:05,700
I just don't.

2035
02:31:05,700 --> 02:31:09,300
I just think the answer is disgustingly simple and kind of annoying here, which is

2036
02:31:09,300 --> 02:31:14,320
they're just better than everyone else at this particular type of math and machine learning,

2037
02:31:14,320 --> 02:31:17,120
and they've been doing it for longer, so they're just going to keep beating you.

2038
02:31:17,720 --> 02:31:23,140
Oh, that's another argument I heard from people, in that Rentech basically is a math department

2039
02:31:23,140 --> 02:31:26,800
in a way that none of these other firms are.

2040
02:31:26,980 --> 02:31:27,720
It could be culture.

2041
02:31:28,080 --> 02:31:28,800
Yeah, it could be culture.

2042
02:31:29,200 --> 02:31:31,680
I mean, honest to God, it could just be that the culture is set up

2043
02:31:31,680 --> 02:31:35,180
in a way that continues to attract the right people and incentivize them

2044
02:31:35,180 --> 02:31:37,640
in a sort of fake altruistic way.

2045
02:31:38,100 --> 02:31:42,340
Like, this is just a fun place to do my work, and yeah, the outcome is getting really rich,

2046
02:31:42,520 --> 02:31:44,440
but I wouldn't go work at Citadel.

2047
02:31:45,060 --> 02:31:46,640
Yeah, I think that could be.

2048
02:31:46,820 --> 02:31:48,380
So maybe that feeds into process power.

2049
02:31:48,800 --> 02:31:49,000
Yeah.

2050
02:31:49,580 --> 02:31:53,380
Okay, for me, it is some combination of process power and counter-positioning,

2051
02:31:53,440 --> 02:31:55,280
and I don't think it's any of the other powers.

2052
02:31:55,660 --> 02:31:58,200
For me, it is process power and cornered resource.

2053
02:31:58,740 --> 02:31:59,980
Yeah. Okay, I buy that.

2054
02:32:00,140 --> 02:32:05,020
And a thing that's not captured in seven powers is tactical, like execution.

2055
02:32:05,180 --> 02:32:09,400
The whole point of seven powers is strategy is different than tactics.

2056
02:32:09,520 --> 02:32:10,920
And I think legitimately,

2057
02:32:11,200 --> 02:32:15,820
Rentech may just have persistently been able to out-execute their competitors.

2058
02:32:16,220 --> 02:32:18,460
There's part of it that's just like, they're smarter than you.

2059
02:32:19,100 --> 02:32:19,120
Yeah.

2060
02:32:19,860 --> 02:32:25,860
Well, if you buy the whole thing gets reinvented continuously every two years, then yes.

2061
02:32:26,400 --> 02:32:27,680
And there's remnant knowledge.

2062
02:32:27,760 --> 02:32:34,320
Like, if you started building a machine learning system in 19-whatever it was,

2063
02:32:35,180 --> 02:32:39,140
64, you're going to be really good at machine learning today.

2064
02:32:39,220 --> 02:32:42,740
And the people that you've been spending time with for the last 15 years,

2065
02:32:42,800 --> 02:32:46,640
learning all of your historical knowledge and working in your systems are also going

2066
02:32:46,640 --> 02:32:50,460
to be better at machine learning than probably the other people who are out in the world,

2067
02:32:50,460 --> 02:32:55,560
learning it from people that just got inspired to start learning machine learning

2068
02:32:55,560 --> 02:32:57,500
based on the new hotness.

2069
02:32:57,960 --> 02:32:59,620
So learnings compound is my answer.

2070
02:33:00,120 --> 02:33:00,400
Great.

2071
02:33:01,060 --> 02:33:01,400
Okay.

2072
02:33:02,220 --> 02:33:02,900
Playbook.

2073
02:33:03,160 --> 02:33:05,120
So in addition to the three-part David.

2074
02:33:05,120 --> 02:33:07,540
David Rosenthal tapestry that you have woven.

2075
02:33:07,800 --> 02:33:08,720
I have nothing more to add.

2076
02:33:09,120 --> 02:33:12,520
There are a handful of things that I think are worth hitting.

2077
02:33:12,700 --> 02:33:17,580
So the first one is signal processing is signal processing is signal processing.

2078
02:33:18,020 --> 02:33:24,880
They, by not caring about the underlying assets, they literally don't trade on fundamentals,

2079
02:33:25,040 --> 02:33:27,600
except in the institutional fund when they trade on fundamentals a little bit.

2080
02:33:27,600 --> 02:33:31,240
They use price-to-earnings ratios and stuff like that in the institutional fund,

2081
02:33:31,360 --> 02:33:34,400
which is kind of funny because that's a completely different skill set.

2082
02:33:34,400 --> 02:33:40,400
But if you just look at medallion, it's all just abstract numbers.

2083
02:33:41,240 --> 02:33:45,360
You don't actually have to care about what underlies those numbers.

2084
02:33:45,540 --> 02:33:50,500
You just have to look for whether it's linear regression or any of the fancier stuff that

2085
02:33:50,500 --> 02:33:52,920
they do, just relationships between data.

2086
02:33:53,320 --> 02:34:00,660
And once you reduce it to that, it is so brilliant that they can just recruit from any field.

2087
02:34:00,660 --> 02:34:03,660
It's not relevant how someone has done sophisticated.

2088
02:34:04,400 --> 02:34:08,620
Signal processing in the past, whether it's being an astronomer and trying to denoise

2089
02:34:08,620 --> 02:34:12,480
a quote-unquote photo of a star super far away,

2090
02:34:12,580 --> 02:34:16,540
or whether they've tried to do like natural language processing, it's just signal.

2091
02:34:16,840 --> 02:34:23,020
There's this really funny line that Jim and Peter and others will say when asked about why

2092
02:34:23,020 --> 02:34:26,340
they only hire academics and not from Wall Street and whatnot. And they're like,

2093
02:34:26,340 --> 02:34:32,900
well, we found it's easier to teach smart people the investing business than teach investing people

2094
02:34:32,900 --> 02:34:33,720
how to be smart.

2095
02:34:34,400 --> 02:34:37,380
Right. That's ridiculous. They don't teach anybody anything about investing.

2096
02:34:37,700 --> 02:34:42,600
They're just doing signal processing. I bet at least half the people at Rentech

2097
02:34:42,600 --> 02:34:45,000
on the research side could not read a balance sheet.

2098
02:34:45,220 --> 02:34:48,220
It's so funny. It's a whole bunch of people who are in the investment business,

2099
02:34:48,300 --> 02:34:49,180
none of which are investors.

2100
02:34:49,640 --> 02:34:49,880
Yes.

2101
02:34:50,260 --> 02:34:55,840
Another one that you can decide if this fits or not. I was thinking a lot about complex

2102
02:34:55,840 --> 02:35:00,460
adaptive systems. It's always been on my mind since we had the NZS Capital guys on a few years

2103
02:35:00,460 --> 02:35:03,560
ago and read their work and the Santa Fe Institute's work on this.

2104
02:35:04,040 --> 02:35:04,220
Right.

2105
02:35:04,220 --> 02:35:04,280
Right.

2106
02:35:04,280 --> 02:35:04,300
Right.

2107
02:35:04,300 --> 02:35:04,360
Right.

2108
02:35:04,360 --> 02:35:04,380
Right.

2109
02:35:04,380 --> 02:35:04,400
Right.

2110
02:35:04,400 --> 02:35:08,640
In a complex adaptive system, it's really difficult to actually understand how one thing

2111
02:35:08,640 --> 02:35:14,060
affects everything else. Because the idea is the relationships are so combinatorially complex that

2112
02:35:14,060 --> 02:35:19,240
you can't deterministically nail down this one thing as the cause of that other thing. It's

2113
02:35:19,240 --> 02:35:25,060
the butterfly flapping its wings. But there are relationships between entities that you can't

2114
02:35:25,060 --> 02:35:30,400
understand or see on the surface. Do you remember way back when we did our second NVIDIA episode,

2115
02:35:30,400 --> 02:35:34,360
I opened with the idea that when I was a kid, I always used to look at fire,

2116
02:35:34,360 --> 02:36:04,140
and think like, if you actually knew the composition of the atoms in the wood, and you actually knew the way the wind was blowing, and you actually knew that, like all the, could you actually model the fire? And when I was a kid, and you always just assumed no. But actually, the answer is yes. This is a known thing of what will happen when you light this log on fire for the next three hours. And can you see exactly the flames? I think Rentech has basically, they haven't figured that out for the market. They can't predict the future.

2117
02:36:04,140 --> 02:36:34,120
But if they have a 50.01% chance of being correct, then they can sort of take a complex adaptive system and say, we don't really care that it's a complex adaptive system. Our models understand enough about the relationships between all these entities, that we're just going to run the simulation a bunch of times, and we're going to be profitable enough from all the little pennies that we're collecting on all the little coin flips, where we have a slight edge over and over and over and over again, that they're sort of the closest in the world to being able to

2118
02:36:34,140 --> 02:36:44,020
actually predict how the complex adaptive system of the market will work. Now, I don't think they can back out to it. No person could explain it, but I think their computers can.

2119
02:36:44,180 --> 02:37:04,020
Yes. And I think when I've heard people from Rentech talk about this, they will all say, the model does not actually understand the market, but it can predict, and we can be so confident in its predictions about what the market will do.

2120
02:37:04,140 --> 02:37:34,120
And I think when I've heard people from Rentech talk about this, they will all say, the model does not actually understand the market, but it can predict, and we can be so confident in its predictions about what the market will do.

2144
02:49:04,140 --> 02:49:11,840
But it's literally the same business model as a casino. You have a slight edge, and you let a whole bunch of patrons come in and lose money to you in your slight edge.

2145
02:49:11,940 --> 02:49:22,660
Well, where I was going with the service provider, I think casinos are service providers. They are providing entertainment to their customers. Everybody knows that the games are stacked in the casino's favor.

2146
02:49:23,360 --> 02:49:34,120
Similarly, I think you could make an argument, and I think this is probably quite accurate, that Rentech and all other quant firms like them are providing a service to the casino.

2147
02:49:34,140 --> 02:49:57,340
Absolutely. That is the undeniable, yes, quant funds create value in the world thing, which I think it's very easy to say quant funds provide no value, because it's like it's zero-sum, they're not actually providing the capital to businesses to do something with.

2148
02:49:57,340 --> 02:50:02,440
They're purely looking to do an arbitrage or any of the strategies we've talked about this episode.

2149
02:50:03,060 --> 02:50:04,120
But you're totally right.

2150
02:50:04,140 --> 02:50:23,420
You're totally right that there is a value to market liquidity. Creating more depth to a market makes it so that if we go back to the era that Renaissance was started, there's no chance that retail is able to function like it does today with zero transaction fees and people able to invest in all these different companies at near real time.

2151
02:50:23,420 --> 02:50:33,280
And any single one of us can go buy a security in just about any market at just about any time of day.

2152
02:50:33,520 --> 02:50:34,120
Pretty.

2153
02:50:34,140 --> 02:50:39,360
Pretty much instantaneously and get a very, very, very granular price on it.

2154
02:50:39,760 --> 02:50:39,960
Yep.

2155
02:50:40,180 --> 02:50:41,520
None of which used to be true.

2156
02:50:42,000 --> 02:50:42,220
Nope.

2157
02:50:42,760 --> 02:50:51,860
The fact that there is a whole bunch of quant funds, hedge funds out there that are ready to be willing counterparties to anyone who wants to trade, that is a service.

2158
02:50:52,120 --> 02:50:52,500
You're right.

2159
02:50:53,120 --> 02:50:55,380
They're also not all medallion.

2160
02:50:55,700 --> 02:50:58,680
They actually don't all have an edge, even though they might purport to.

2161
02:50:59,080 --> 02:51:00,980
Lots of them are going to lose money to you.

2162
02:51:01,220 --> 02:51:01,660
Right.

2163
02:51:01,920 --> 02:51:02,900
Lots of them lose money.

2164
02:51:03,360 --> 02:51:04,120
You too, listeners.

2165
02:51:04,300 --> 02:51:04,920
Could beat the market.

2166
02:51:05,220 --> 02:51:06,040
Not investment advice.

2167
02:51:06,240 --> 02:51:06,880
Please don't try.

2168
02:51:07,380 --> 02:51:07,600
Right.

2169
02:51:07,600 --> 02:51:09,800
On average, medallion will not lose money to you.

2170
02:51:09,940 --> 02:51:17,020
But, you know, there are plenty of other hedge funds out there and high frequency shops and counterparties for you where you could take them.

2171
02:51:17,240 --> 02:51:18,500
It's just not Jim Simons.

2172
02:51:22,840 --> 02:51:26,300
There's this great, great vignette at the end of Greg's book.

2173
02:51:26,640 --> 02:51:33,560
It was during one of the like sell-offs in the mid-20-teens in the market where Jim calls the head of his family office.

2174
02:51:33,560 --> 02:51:40,760
He's, you know, long retired from rent tech at this point, calls the head of his family office and says, what should we do with all the sell-off in the market?

2175
02:51:40,820 --> 02:51:42,620
And it's like, you're Jim Simons.

2176
02:51:42,740 --> 02:51:42,980
Right.

2177
02:51:43,620 --> 02:51:44,380
You're Jim Simons.

2178
02:51:44,460 --> 02:51:45,140
What should we do?

2179
02:51:45,280 --> 02:51:46,140
What should we do?

2180
02:51:46,460 --> 02:51:46,660
Yeah.

2181
02:51:48,760 --> 02:51:49,160
Yeah.

2182
02:51:49,240 --> 02:51:50,240
All humans are fallible.

2183
02:51:50,820 --> 02:51:51,140
Totally.

2184
02:51:51,840 --> 02:51:53,940
A couple of other are squintable.

2185
02:51:54,160 --> 02:51:55,280
The value creation exists.

2186
02:51:55,820 --> 02:52:01,920
It's easy to knock that all these smart people are going into finance and you wish they were doing something more productive for the world.

2187
02:52:01,920 --> 02:52:06,600
At the end of the day, humans are going to do what they are incented to do.

2188
02:52:07,180 --> 02:52:12,460
And so absent a larger global concern that is incredibly motivating to people.

2189
02:52:12,560 --> 02:52:20,360
I mean, you look at World War II, people's level of patriotism and wanting to go save the world from evil was a huge, unbelievable motivating factor to move mountains.

2190
02:52:20,980 --> 02:52:29,780
When that is absent or when people feel that there's some existential thing that is absent, they're going to go do what's best for them and their family.

2191
02:52:29,780 --> 02:52:31,780
And if they're an empire builder, go build empires.

2192
02:52:32,480 --> 02:52:34,800
And if they're a fierce capitalist, go make a bunch of money.

2193
02:52:35,260 --> 02:52:38,000
And so the system is set up the way that it is.

2194
02:52:38,040 --> 02:52:39,360
So, like, you can be mad about that.

2195
02:52:40,120 --> 02:52:45,780
Given that, okay, people are going to go engage in quantitative finance as a lucrative profession.

2196
02:52:46,520 --> 02:52:49,860
Fortunately, there's a bunch of valuable stuff that comes out of that.

2197
02:52:49,860 --> 02:53:01,900
And I think that is often missed is that these really lucrative professions and businesses can often produce R&D that becomes valuable elsewhere.

2198
02:53:02,460 --> 02:53:04,780
For example, we just did this big NVIDIA series.

2199
02:53:05,360 --> 02:53:09,060
What do you think Mellanox was used for before large language models?

2200
02:53:09,600 --> 02:53:10,380
Oh, yes.

2201
02:53:10,960 --> 02:53:16,920
This is such a really mind-blowing point here in value creation, value capture.

2202
02:53:17,480 --> 02:53:17,980
Go for it.

2203
02:53:18,060 --> 02:53:18,440
Take it away.

2204
02:53:18,440 --> 02:53:24,960
Well, there's not much to it other than a huge amount of InfiniBand was used by high-frequency trading firms.

2205
02:53:25,360 --> 02:53:29,680
And I don't know for sure, but I kind of think Mellanox built their business on quant finance.

2206
02:53:30,320 --> 02:53:30,500
Yes.

2207
02:53:31,040 --> 02:53:31,440
That's one of...

2208
02:53:31,920 --> 02:53:32,680
Of many examples.

2209
02:53:33,000 --> 02:53:35,000
But now, you know, that has limits.

2210
02:53:35,480 --> 02:53:39,800
But I think it goes overlooked that there's a lot of technology innovation here.

2211
02:53:40,240 --> 02:53:40,460
Yep.

2212
02:53:40,860 --> 02:53:42,360
These are all great points.

2213
02:53:42,540 --> 02:53:43,840
They all came up in the research.

2214
02:53:44,320 --> 02:53:46,740
I totally agree with all of them.

2215
02:53:46,920 --> 02:53:56,400
It is, in my opinion, false to say that quantitative finance does not create value for the world.

2216
02:53:56,640 --> 02:53:58,280
It definitely does, in my opinion.

2217
02:53:58,760 --> 02:54:01,100
But does it create anywhere near as much as it captures?

2218
02:54:01,940 --> 02:54:06,080
That said, they're really, really good at value capture.

2219
02:54:06,620 --> 02:54:07,020
Yes.

2220
02:54:07,460 --> 02:54:09,040
This is not Wikipedia here.

2221
02:54:09,400 --> 02:54:12,300
This is about as far away on the spectrum as you can get.

2222
02:54:12,420 --> 02:54:19,960
There's a great Always Sunny in Philadelphia where Frank, Danny DeVito, sort of goes back to his whatever business he founded in the 80s.

2223
02:54:20,000 --> 02:54:22,260
And he's, like, dressing in his pinstripes and stuff again.

2224
02:54:22,320 --> 02:54:23,140
And he's taken back over.

2225
02:54:23,200 --> 02:54:24,140
He brings Charlie with him.

2226
02:54:24,540 --> 02:54:26,920
And Charlie, you know, he's like, so, Frank, what is the business?

2227
02:54:27,220 --> 02:54:28,140
What do we do here?

2228
02:54:28,620 --> 02:54:29,680
What does the business make?

2229
02:54:30,440 --> 02:54:30,940
And Danny...

2230
02:54:30,940 --> 02:54:32,800
Danny DeVito looks at him and he goes, what do you mean?

2231
02:54:33,040 --> 02:54:33,640
We make money.

2232
02:54:34,160 --> 02:54:34,900
He's like, no, no.

2233
02:54:34,940 --> 02:54:35,840
Like, what do you build?

2234
02:54:36,060 --> 02:54:37,340
He goes, we build wealth.

2235
02:54:37,680 --> 02:54:41,320
I think that's a pretty good meme for kind of what's going on here.

2236
02:54:42,040 --> 02:54:42,060
Yeah.

2237
02:54:42,560 --> 02:54:42,960
Totally.

2238
02:54:43,380 --> 02:54:45,020
Very, very good at value capture, too.

2239
02:54:45,320 --> 02:54:45,560
Yes.

2240
02:54:46,400 --> 02:54:46,780
Okay.

2241
02:54:47,140 --> 02:54:48,020
Bear, bull.

2242
02:54:48,220 --> 02:54:52,160
So, this was a section that we had for a long time that we did not put in the last episode.

2243
02:54:52,260 --> 02:54:53,420
And boy, did we hear about it.

2244
02:54:53,500 --> 02:54:56,540
So, listeners, thank you so much for expressing your concern.

2245
02:54:57,100 --> 02:54:59,920
Bear versus bull is unkilled and it is back.

2246
02:55:00,400 --> 02:55:00,820
Resurrected.

2247
02:55:00,940 --> 02:55:01,500
Like a phoenix.

2248
02:55:02,180 --> 02:55:02,580
Resurrected.

2249
02:55:03,060 --> 02:55:05,940
However, this is about the lamest episode to resurrect it on.

2250
02:55:06,200 --> 02:55:07,740
What's the bull case for Rentech?

2251
02:55:07,960 --> 02:55:10,780
Past performance is an indicator of future success.

2252
02:55:10,920 --> 02:55:11,100
Right.

2253
02:55:11,160 --> 02:55:13,360
Like, they're going to keep attracting all the smartest people in the world.

2254
02:55:13,360 --> 02:55:16,980
They're going to have the ability to keep their incredibly unique culture.

2255
02:55:17,320 --> 02:55:23,020
They're not going to get tempted to let the business of institutional funds become the

2256
02:55:23,020 --> 02:55:23,860
dominant business.

2257
02:55:24,640 --> 02:55:27,240
You know, keep on keeping on is basically the bull case.

2258
02:55:27,440 --> 02:55:29,700
Maybe that they're actually still ahead.

2259
02:55:30,180 --> 02:55:30,720
The bull case.

2260
02:55:30,720 --> 02:55:37,860
It's for the GP and LP stakeholders in Medallion, which is, I don't know, 500 people in the

2261
02:55:37,860 --> 02:55:41,660
world and none of the rest of us can get any exposure to it.

2262
02:55:42,140 --> 02:55:42,280
Yeah.

2263
02:55:42,540 --> 02:55:44,580
The bear case is things are changing.

2264
02:55:44,920 --> 02:55:49,740
And I think things are changing basically on any axis is the bear case for them.

2265
02:55:49,860 --> 02:55:52,160
So, things are changing where competitors are catching up.

2266
02:55:52,640 --> 02:55:53,000
Maybe.

2267
02:55:53,440 --> 02:55:58,860
Maybe the fact that the tech industry has figured out these large language models, maybe

2268
02:55:58,860 --> 02:56:00,340
that trickles into.

2269
02:56:00,720 --> 02:56:02,500
Making it easier to compete with Rentech.

2270
02:56:02,620 --> 02:56:04,860
It's a blurry line, but it is plausible.

2271
02:56:05,040 --> 02:56:07,680
Like, maybe Rentech actually was here a decade before everyone else.

2272
02:56:07,760 --> 02:56:09,720
And now everyone else has arrived to the party.

2273
02:56:10,880 --> 02:56:13,540
There's things that are changing maybe about their culture.

2274
02:56:13,840 --> 02:56:15,920
Like, Jim Symes has been gone for a long time.

2275
02:56:16,400 --> 02:56:18,880
Bob Mercer is no longer a co-CEO.

2276
02:56:19,220 --> 02:56:20,660
Peter Brown is a co-CEO.

2277
02:56:20,720 --> 02:56:24,900
And they just announced that they're making the guy who was in charge of the institutional

2278
02:56:24,900 --> 02:56:29,320
funds, David Lippe, he is becoming a co-CEO as well.

2279
02:56:29,740 --> 02:56:30,700
So, maybe there's a.

2280
02:56:30,720 --> 02:56:34,840
There's a bear case around that, that someone from the institutional side of the house is

2281
02:56:34,840 --> 02:56:40,540
becoming the current co-CEO and maybe eventually CEO if you believe the medallion is the special

2282
02:56:40,540 --> 02:56:44,080
thing and the institutional funds are sort of a blemish on the business.

2283
02:56:44,700 --> 02:56:48,820
You know, they're the Hermes Apple Watch strap in David's parlance.

2284
02:56:49,620 --> 02:56:51,020
Maybe that's a bear case.

2285
02:56:51,320 --> 02:56:56,320
Maybe there's a bear case that their talent is becoming kind of the same as everyone else's

2286
02:56:56,320 --> 02:56:56,620
talent.

2287
02:56:56,620 --> 02:57:00,700
When you look on LinkedIn, I recognize a lot of the companies that people worked at.

2288
02:57:00,700 --> 02:57:02,980
Who are more junior at Rentech.

2289
02:57:03,200 --> 02:57:07,200
And in the past, I think it would have been all people just out of university research

2290
02:57:07,200 --> 02:57:07,800
shops.

2291
02:57:08,000 --> 02:57:14,360
So, I think if it's true that they're starting to see the same talent flow as everyone else,

2292
02:57:14,380 --> 02:57:15,240
that would be concerning.

2293
02:57:15,640 --> 02:57:19,180
These things are all sort of narratives you can concoct and really no way to know if they're

2294
02:57:19,180 --> 02:57:19,680
true or not.

2295
02:57:20,020 --> 02:57:20,100
Right.

2296
02:57:20,400 --> 02:57:23,960
There's no way for us to know any of this because there's no way to know any of this.

2297
02:57:24,280 --> 02:57:24,680
Right.

2298
02:57:24,820 --> 02:57:26,040
It's all the secret.

2299
02:57:26,660 --> 02:57:26,860
Yep.

2300
02:57:27,580 --> 02:57:27,900
Okay.

2301
02:57:27,900 --> 02:57:29,880
Our new ending section.

2302
02:57:29,880 --> 02:57:32,220
The splinter in our minds.

2303
02:57:32,380 --> 02:57:32,860
The takeaway.

2304
02:57:33,520 --> 02:57:35,440
The one thing you can't stop thinking about.

2305
02:57:35,660 --> 02:57:42,920
What is the one thing for each of us, personally, from doing this work over the past month on

2306
02:57:42,920 --> 02:57:45,080
Rentech that sticks with us?

2307
02:57:45,780 --> 02:57:50,520
For me, perhaps this is obvious from my little diatribe on the tapestry.

2308
02:57:51,060 --> 02:57:58,220
I just think this is such a powerful example of the power of incentives and getting them

2309
02:57:58,220 --> 02:57:58,660
right.

2310
02:57:58,660 --> 02:57:58,720
Right.

2311
02:57:58,720 --> 02:57:58,960
Right.

2312
02:57:58,960 --> 02:57:58,980
Right.

2313
02:57:58,980 --> 02:57:59,000
Right.

2314
02:57:59,000 --> 02:57:59,020
Right.

2315
02:57:59,020 --> 02:57:59,060
Right.

2316
02:57:59,060 --> 02:57:59,080
Right.

2317
02:57:59,080 --> 02:57:59,100
Right.

2318
02:57:59,100 --> 02:57:59,120
Right.

2319
02:57:59,120 --> 02:57:59,140
Right.

2320
02:57:59,140 --> 02:57:59,180
Right.

2321
02:57:59,180 --> 02:57:59,200
Right.

2322
02:57:59,200 --> 02:57:59,220
Right.

2323
02:57:59,220 --> 02:57:59,240
Right.

2324
02:57:59,240 --> 02:57:59,260
Right.

2325
02:57:59,260 --> 02:57:59,540
Right.

2326
02:57:59,540 --> 02:57:59,560
Right.

2327
02:57:59,560 --> 02:57:59,580
Right.

2328
02:57:59,580 --> 02:57:59,640
Right.

2329
02:57:59,640 --> 02:57:59,740
Right.

2330
02:57:59,880 --> 02:58:00,140
Right.

2331
02:58:00,320 --> 02:58:00,440
Right.

2332
02:58:00,440 --> 02:58:01,120
And culture, too.

2333
02:58:01,480 --> 02:58:02,580
I don't want to shortchange that.

2334
02:58:02,700 --> 02:58:10,400
I think the culture of managing an academic environment in a fashion like a lab, but

2335
02:58:10,400 --> 02:58:16,140
without letting it spin into the frivolity of a lab that Jim Simons set up.

2336
02:58:16,420 --> 02:58:16,440
Right.

2337
02:58:16,580 --> 02:58:17,700
In other words, early Google.

2338
02:58:18,200 --> 02:58:18,360
Yeah.

2339
02:58:18,420 --> 02:58:19,500
This is like early Google.

2340
02:58:19,640 --> 02:58:20,100
Exactly.

2341
02:58:21,000 --> 02:58:26,220
There historically has not, from our research, and as best as we can tell currently, is

2342
02:58:26,220 --> 02:58:29,400
not anything going on at Rentech.

2343
02:58:29,400 --> 02:58:31,960
There is no one thing that is frivolous.

2344
02:58:31,960 --> 02:58:36,880
They are all very focused, which again, to me, then speaks back to the power of incentives.

2345
02:58:36,880 --> 02:58:42,420
When you're there with less than 400 people, and on the research and engineering side,

2346
02:58:42,420 --> 02:58:50,800
less than 200 people, and those colleagues who you work with are the sole purveyors,

2347
02:58:50,800 --> 02:58:55,920
supervisors and beneficiaries of all of this that you're doing, like that is so powerful.

2348
02:58:55,920 --> 02:58:56,920
Yeah.

2349
02:58:56,920 --> 02:58:57,960
I can't think of anywhere else like that in the world.

2350
02:58:57,960 --> 02:58:58,960
I mean, maybe not in the United States, but maybe in the United States.

2351
02:58:58,960 --> 02:58:59,960
I can't think of anywhere else in the world.

2352
02:58:59,960 --> 02:59:04,860
I mean, maybe some venture funds or other investment firms, but not on a day-to-day,

2353
02:59:04,860 --> 02:59:07,940
fully liquid, with returns like this.

2354
02:59:07,940 --> 02:59:08,940
There's nothing like it.

2355
02:59:08,940 --> 02:59:09,940
Nope.

2356
02:59:09,940 --> 02:59:11,940
Pure gasoline right into the veins.

2357
02:59:11,940 --> 02:59:13,120
Yeah.

2358
02:59:13,120 --> 02:59:15,140
Which is not to say I would necessarily want to work there.

2359
02:59:15,140 --> 02:59:16,140
I think I would not.

2360
02:59:16,140 --> 02:59:17,140
Totally.

2361
02:59:17,140 --> 02:59:18,140
Yeah.

2362
02:59:18,140 --> 02:59:19,140
But it is truly unique.

2363
02:59:19,140 --> 02:59:20,140
Yep.

2364
02:59:20,140 --> 02:59:24,480
The one thing I can't stop thinking about is the idea of the complex adaptive system

2365
02:59:24,480 --> 02:59:26,120
that I was talking about earlier.

2366
02:59:26,120 --> 02:59:28,520
I think, from everything we can tell from the outside, run a lab, run a lab, run a lab,

2367
02:59:28,520 --> 02:59:35,400
but renaissance actually has built a large-scale computer system that discovers relationships

2368
02:59:35,400 --> 02:59:42,440
between different entities in the world, stocks, commodities, bond prices.

2369
02:59:42,440 --> 02:59:47,460
And whether it can explain them or not it is correct most of the time.

2370
02:59:47,460 --> 02:59:52,420
And it might be a small most, but all you need is most, and then you can operate a casino

2371
02:59:52,420 --> 02:59:53,520
business.

2372
02:59:53,520 --> 02:59:57,540
That is my takeaway, is that they are the house and they have an edge, and that edge

2373
02:59:57,540 --> 03:00:04,400
is predicated on a graph of all the relationships between these entities that we think are just

2374
03:00:04,400 --> 03:00:09,940
noise and they know the signal. It does make you wonder, to what you were talking about with the

2375
03:00:09,940 --> 03:00:18,620
tech industry catching up, quote unquote, in recent years, how hard is it to build this now,

2376
03:00:18,760 --> 03:00:23,080
given the technology, open source and otherwise, that's available for sale out there?

2377
03:00:23,080 --> 03:00:24,940
That's the bear case. I don't know.

2378
03:00:25,300 --> 03:00:29,740
Yeah. And then what's going to happen? By nature, given that it's a complex adaptive system,

2379
03:00:30,340 --> 03:00:34,300
if you can now buy and build this, well, the returns will get arbitraged down.

2380
03:00:34,860 --> 03:00:37,120
Yep. All right. Should we have some fun? Carve-outs?

2381
03:00:37,600 --> 03:00:38,360
Let's have some fun.

2382
03:00:38,780 --> 03:00:42,860
Sweet. All right, listeners, I have three. People have been expressing that they're

2383
03:00:42,860 --> 03:00:45,880
loving the carve-out section, so I decided to load them up a little bit more.

2384
03:00:46,160 --> 03:00:47,580
That's right. Let's indulge.

2385
03:00:47,800 --> 03:00:49,560
We'll spin off a whole new podcast called Carve-outs.

2386
03:00:49,840 --> 03:00:51,560
44% carry. Let's go.

2387
03:00:51,900 --> 03:00:52,740
So I have one announcement.

2388
03:00:53,080 --> 03:00:58,200
One TV show and one other fun thing for listeners. So first, the announcement,

2389
03:00:58,920 --> 03:01:04,260
David and I are going to be emceeing Modern Treasury Transfer again this year. And so if

2390
03:01:04,260 --> 03:01:09,360
payments are your thing, you should come join us. It was awesome last year. It'll be May 15th,

2391
03:01:09,360 --> 03:01:14,280
2024 in San Francisco. And we'll put a link in the show notes to register. We would love to see

2392
03:01:14,280 --> 03:01:14,820
you there.

2393
03:01:15,300 --> 03:01:15,680
Can't wait.

2394
03:01:16,120 --> 03:01:22,160
My second one is a TV show, and it is actually Acquired related. It is called

2395
03:01:22,160 --> 03:01:22,880
The New...

2396
03:01:23,080 --> 03:01:25,260
Look on Apple TV+.

2397
03:01:25,260 --> 03:01:30,140
Oh, yes. But Christiane, it is such a new look.

2398
03:01:31,620 --> 03:01:35,380
Exactly. So for anyone who listened to the LVMH episode, remember we were talking about

2399
03:01:35,380 --> 03:01:40,500
the groundbreaking thing that Christian Dior did was his collection, The New Look,

2400
03:01:40,640 --> 03:01:44,280
that was a post-World War II explosion onto the scene.

2401
03:01:44,740 --> 03:01:45,720
Celebration of life.

2402
03:01:45,720 --> 03:01:51,840
Yes. Gone are the days of the militaristic, boxy clothing, and now we're in with these

2403
03:01:51,840 --> 03:01:52,920
seductive...

2404
03:01:53,080 --> 03:01:55,140
Conductive and, dare I say...

2405
03:01:55,140 --> 03:01:58,300
Sumptuous materials. War rationing is over.

2406
03:01:58,300 --> 03:02:07,060
Exactly. Yes. Provocative dresses. The Apple TV show is this incredible drama of kind of

2407
03:02:07,060 --> 03:02:14,520
flashbacks to the wartime experiences, harrowing wartime experiences of Christian Dior, of

2408
03:02:14,520 --> 03:02:19,840
Balenciaga, of Coco Chanel, and everything they went through and how all their paths crossed.

2409
03:02:20,340 --> 03:02:21,720
Oh, Coco's in it.

2410
03:02:21,800 --> 03:02:22,160
Yes.

2411
03:02:22,160 --> 03:02:23,040
Oh, wow.

2412
03:02:23,100 --> 03:02:24,000
How do they treat that?

2413
03:02:24,540 --> 03:02:29,740
It will be very interesting if a lot of people watch this show to see if that affects product

2414
03:02:29,740 --> 03:02:34,000
sales of Chanel. I'm also very curious, for people who are watching, feel free to put a

2415
03:02:34,000 --> 03:02:38,400
thing in the Slack in carve-outs. Do you think she's a sympathetic figure? Do you think she's

2416
03:02:38,400 --> 03:02:42,620
a villainous figure? I'm curious how you think of her portrayal versus reality.

2417
03:02:42,920 --> 03:02:48,480
Well, there's the whole crazy thing with Chanel where the company ends up getting bought by

2418
03:02:48,480 --> 03:02:52,460
Chanel the Perfume Division, which is the two Jewish brothers in New York.

2419
03:02:52,460 --> 03:02:53,060
The Worth.

2420
03:02:53,080 --> 03:02:58,220
The Worth, indeed. Oh, God, we got to do a Chanel episode at some point. But the new look on Apple

2421
03:02:58,220 --> 03:03:03,760
TV+, I promise you, whether or not fashion luxury is your thing, it's a beautiful and harrowing story.

2422
03:03:04,260 --> 03:03:08,800
Oh, as you and listeners know, I'm not a TV guy, but this is so up my alley.

2423
03:03:09,020 --> 03:03:11,460
The whole thing, it takes place in wartime Paris.

2424
03:03:11,960 --> 03:03:13,580
Oh, all right. I got to watch it.

2425
03:03:13,620 --> 03:03:18,800
You got to watch it. Okay. My third one is a fun thing for listeners. So after our Nike episode,

2426
03:03:18,800 --> 03:03:22,860
the president of Cole Haan, which if you listen to the episode, you now know,

2427
03:03:22,860 --> 03:03:27,140
is its own company, spun out from Nike years ago. The president of Cole Haan reached out,

2428
03:03:27,260 --> 03:03:31,840
and it turns out he, like all of you, is also an acquired listener. And so we were chatting,

2429
03:03:32,040 --> 03:03:36,380
and he brought up the idea that they'd be happy to create a specific Cole Haan deal

2430
03:03:36,380 --> 03:03:40,800
for acquired listeners. And I told him, frankly, if it's good enough, then I'll share it on air.

2431
03:03:41,180 --> 03:03:45,820
To be clear, this is not a sponsorship. This is just like, he's a fan and reached out to us.

2432
03:03:46,140 --> 03:03:49,000
And I've owned a bunch of Cole Haan products over the years and I've really liked them. So

2433
03:03:49,000 --> 03:03:52,420
for 35% off anything,

2434
03:03:52,860 --> 03:03:59,880
you can go to colehaan.com slash acquired or use the code acquired35 at checkout. And thank you to

2435
03:03:59,880 --> 03:04:04,700
Dave for providing this to us. This is only live, I think for a couple of weeks. So if you're

2436
03:04:04,700 --> 03:04:09,420
listening to this episode soon after it drops, go check it out. I think they intentionally want

2437
03:04:09,420 --> 03:04:13,660
to cut it off at some point so it doesn't get shared around all the coupon sites, but fun thing

2438
03:04:13,660 --> 03:04:17,760
for acquired listeners. Super cool. He likes acquired and wanted to share the love back.

2439
03:04:17,920 --> 03:04:20,680
Love it. I love it. All right, David, your carve outs.

2440
03:04:21,300 --> 03:04:22,300
My carve out is

2441
03:04:22,300 --> 03:04:31,180
related to the new look in a very different way, but both video consumption and fashion and luxury

2442
03:04:31,180 --> 03:04:41,860
and style. It is the class of Palm Beach, Instagram and TikTok account. This is so great.

2443
03:04:42,100 --> 03:04:46,240
David, you and I go to Palm Beach for two days and you get hooked on.

2444
03:04:46,500 --> 03:04:51,080
This is amazing. So Ben and I went to Palm Beach for a couple of days for a speaking event recently,

2445
03:04:51,080 --> 03:04:52,280
which was amazing.

2446
03:04:52,300 --> 03:04:53,800
I'd never been to Palm Beach before.

2447
03:04:54,260 --> 03:04:54,820
Ooh, it is nice.

2448
03:04:55,140 --> 03:05:00,020
So great. We didn't knowingly spot any Rentech people there, but we may have.

2449
03:05:00,280 --> 03:05:02,260
We did knowingly spot some Birkin bags though.

2450
03:05:02,780 --> 03:05:10,860
Yes. The style in Palm Beach. We had just recorded the Hermes episode and oh man,

2451
03:05:11,120 --> 03:05:17,300
I was so pleased to be there. And then I got home and Jenny, my wife was like,

2452
03:05:17,780 --> 03:05:19,920
do you not know the class of Palm Beach TikTok account?

2453
03:05:19,920 --> 03:05:22,280
And David's like, I'm a thousand. I have no idea what you're talking.

2454
03:05:22,300 --> 03:05:25,580
Yeah, right, right, right. I live under a rock. I'm a dad.

2455
03:05:26,780 --> 03:05:31,480
And she showed it to me. This is a woman who lives in Palm Beach and she goes around,

2456
03:05:31,540 --> 03:05:35,540
she posts on Instagram and on TikTok and she just interviews people on the street about

2457
03:05:35,540 --> 03:05:40,880
what they're wearing, what brands they're wearing, their style. It is magnificent.

2458
03:05:41,340 --> 03:05:44,400
My favorite is, we'll see if we can find it and link to it in the show notes.

2459
03:05:44,660 --> 03:05:51,220
There's a video of one woman who's being interviewed who has a mini Kelly inside her Birkin.

2460
03:05:51,220 --> 03:05:52,220
Oh, excellent.

2461
03:05:52,300 --> 03:05:53,860
Excess. Truly excess.

2462
03:05:54,220 --> 03:05:58,160
And that's when I was hooked. I was just like, this is the greatest thing I have ever watched.

2463
03:06:01,000 --> 03:06:01,780
I'm obsessed.

2464
03:06:02,540 --> 03:06:05,280
All right. If I used TikTok, I would subscribe.

2465
03:06:05,960 --> 03:06:07,240
No, you can get it on Instagram too.

2466
03:06:07,320 --> 03:06:08,020
Oh, all right. Good.

2467
03:06:08,180 --> 03:06:12,980
I actually subscribed the acquired account on Instagram to class of Palm Beach. I don't know

2468
03:06:12,980 --> 03:06:16,040
how many people we're following. It's not many, but we are following class of Palm Beach.

2469
03:06:16,220 --> 03:06:19,680
Look at David opening up our Instagram account. You're so youthful.

2470
03:06:20,080 --> 03:06:20,520
Oh, no.

2471
03:06:20,820 --> 03:06:21,880
All right, listeners.

2472
03:06:22,300 --> 03:06:28,420
Well, a huge, huge thank you to JP Morgan Payments, ServiceNow, and Vanta. You can click

2473
03:06:28,420 --> 03:06:34,060
the link in the show notes to learn more. David, I know you've got some thank yous from folks you

2474
03:06:34,060 --> 03:06:35,860
talked with and a few of them we did together.

2475
03:06:36,780 --> 03:06:41,940
Yes. For sources for this episode who were so generous with their time and thoughts. First,

2476
03:06:42,120 --> 03:06:45,540
huge thank you to Greg Zuckerman, author of The Man Who Solved the Market,

2477
03:06:46,100 --> 03:06:50,440
the canonical book out there about Rentech and Jim Simons. Greg was super generous,

2478
03:06:50,640 --> 03:06:52,200
spending time talking to us.

2479
03:06:52,300 --> 03:06:57,920
Emailing with us, making sure we're getting things right. He also, he and the book is

2480
03:06:57,920 --> 03:07:05,820
the canonical source of Medallion's investment returns. And I know he worked so hard to get

2481
03:07:05,820 --> 03:07:09,260
that table together that is now all over the internet as it should be.

2482
03:07:09,780 --> 03:07:14,980
It is crazy. Everywhere you hear that 66% number quoted, and that is from Greg's analysis.

2483
03:07:15,600 --> 03:07:20,660
Yes. Truly a service to us and to corporate historians and financial historians everywhere

2484
03:07:20,660 --> 03:07:22,140
that he did that research and got those returns.

2485
03:07:22,140 --> 03:07:22,220
Thank you.

2486
03:07:22,220 --> 03:07:22,260
Thank you.

2487
03:07:22,260 --> 03:07:22,280
Thank you.

2488
03:07:22,300 --> 03:07:27,520
And there's a few other primary sources. There's really not much. So we can actually list

2489
03:07:27,520 --> 03:07:32,920
all of them here. There's a congressional testimony of Peter Brown about the basket

2490
03:07:32,920 --> 03:07:37,360
options thing. There's Peter Brown doing an interview at GS Exchanges, which again,

2491
03:07:37,480 --> 03:07:41,260
many of the questions were straight out of Greg's book and the stories told.

2492
03:07:42,080 --> 03:07:45,640
Yeah. It's a funny moment where Peter's like, where are you getting these questions? How do

2493
03:07:45,640 --> 03:07:48,140
you know all this stuff? And I'm like, come on. They read the book.

2494
03:07:48,140 --> 03:07:52,260
Clearly. There's a great book called The Quants, which is,

2495
03:07:52,260 --> 03:07:57,480
it's a little bit earlier. I think it's 2011. So it's not as updated as The Man Who Solved the

2496
03:07:57,480 --> 03:08:01,600
Market. And there's only sort of a couple chapters about Rentech, but some good stuff in there. And

2497
03:08:01,600 --> 03:08:06,680
then there's a good Bloomberg piece from 2016 that we'll link to that. I think between that

2498
03:08:06,680 --> 03:08:10,840
and The Quants, it was sort of the first time there was really anything at all that was published

2499
03:08:10,840 --> 03:08:15,420
about Rentech. So all those will be in the show notes. Other people to thank, David.

2500
03:08:16,060 --> 03:08:18,720
Other people to thank, Howard Morgan, who we spoke to, which was

2501
03:08:18,720 --> 03:08:22,100
so fun to get a bunch of the first round history from him. And then of course,

2502
03:08:22,100 --> 03:08:27,260
the founding of Rentech and partnering with Jim and investing in each other's funds and all that.

2503
03:08:27,520 --> 03:08:34,200
So fun. Brett Harrison, who you mentioned, Ben. Brett is now building Architect, which I love

2504
03:08:34,200 --> 03:08:38,720
this. This is so needed in the world. It's the interactive brokers for the 21st century.

2505
03:08:39,840 --> 03:08:45,540
Well, anybody who uses interactive brokers knows exactly the opportunity there. So thank you,

2506
03:08:45,540 --> 03:08:51,820
Brett. And then Matthew Grenade, who I spoke with. Matt is the co-founder of Domino

2507
03:08:51,820 --> 03:08:56,920
Data Lab, which is a great enterprise AI ops platform backed by Sequoia and many others.

2508
03:08:57,100 --> 03:09:02,240
It allows model-driven businesses and products to accelerate research, increase collaboration,

2509
03:09:02,880 --> 03:09:07,400
rapidly deliver new machine learning models, all of the sorts of things that we were talking about

2510
03:09:07,400 --> 03:09:15,120
here with Rentech. Matt, before starting Domino Data, came out of the quant world. He was at 0.72

2511
03:09:15,120 --> 03:09:20,040
and Bridgewater, which isn't really quant, sort of its own thing, but he was a longtime senior

2512
03:09:20,040 --> 03:09:21,800
employee at both of those firms. And Matt, who is the co-founder of Domino Data Lab,

2513
03:09:21,820 --> 03:09:27,960
he gave us great, great perspective on the landscape of everybody out there and where

2514
03:09:27,960 --> 03:09:32,640
Rentech fits in. Awesome. Well, if you liked this episode, you should check out our Berkshire

2521
03:10:02,620 --> 03:10:10,100
et cetera. Yep. All modern GLP1s. Lata Bier-Nudson from Novo Nordisk was awesome to have her on the

2522
03:10:10,100 --> 03:10:14,080
show. And after you finish this episode, come talk about it with other smart members of the
