1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
Remember George Washington? You know how he died? Well-meaning physicians bled him to death,

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,840
and this was the most important patient in the country, maybe in the history of the country,

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:17,200
and we bled him to death trying to help him. So when you're actually inflating the money supply

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:24,160
at 7% but you're calling it 2% because you want to help the economy, you're literally bleeding

5
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:30,800
the free market to death. But the sad fact is George Washington went along with it because he

6
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:38,000
thought that they were going to do him good, and the majority of the society, most companies,

7
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:46,320
most conventional thinkers, you know, the working class, they go along with this because they think

8
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,880
that someone has their best interests at mind, and the people that are bleeding them to death

9
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:56,320
believe, they believe that prescription because their mental models are just so defective.

10
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:03,280
The following is a conversation with Michael Saylor, one of the most prominent and brilliant

11
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:10,080
Bitcoin proponents in the world. He is the CEO of MicroStrategy, founder of Saylor Academy,

12
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:16,640
graduate of MIT, and Michael is one of the most fascinating and rigorous thinkers I've ever gotten

13
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,840
a chance to explore ideas with. He can effortlessly zoom out to the big perspectives of human

14
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:28,640
civilization and human history, and zoom back in to the technical details of blockchains, markets,

15
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:34,240
governments, and financial systems. This is the Lex Friedman podcast. To support it,

16
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:40,560
please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Michael Saylor.

17
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:49,120
Here's Michael Saylor. Let's start with a big question of truth and wisdom. When advanced humans

18
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:55,920
or aliens or AI systems, let's say five to ten centuries from now, look back at Earth on this

19
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:03,600
early 21st century, how much do you think they would say we understood about money and economics,

20
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,560
or even about engineering, science, life, death, meaning, intelligence, consciousness, all the big

21
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:15,680
interesting questions? I think they would probably give us a

22
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,960
B-minus on engineering, on all the engineering things, the hard sciences.

23
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:28,720
A passing grade. Like we're doing okay. We're working our way through rockets and jets and

24
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:36,320
electric cars and electricity transport systems and nuclear power and space flight and the like.

25
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:46,400
And if you look at the walls that grace the great court at MIT, it's full of all the great thinkers

26
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:55,840
and they're all pretty admirable. If you could be with Newton or Gauss or Madame Curie or Einstein,

27
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:03,760
you would respect them. I would say they'd give us a D-minus on economics.

28
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,960
Like an F-plus or a D-minus. You have an optimistic vision. First of all,

29
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:14,000
optimistic vision of engineering, because everybody you've listed, not everybody,

30
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,120
but most people you've listed, it's just over the past couple of centuries. And maybe it stretches

31
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,000
a little farther back, but mostly all the cool stuff we've done in engineering is the past couple

32
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:32,480
of centuries. I mean, Archimedes had his virtues. I studied the history of science at MIT,

33
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:38,960
and I also studied aerospace engineering. And so I clearly have a bias in favor of science.

34
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:46,080
And if I look at the past 10,000 years and I consider all of the philosophy and the politics

35
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,520
and their impact on the human condition, I think it's a wash for every politician that came up with

36
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:59,120
a good idea. Another politician came up with a bad idea. And it's not clear to me that most of

37
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:06,400
the political and philosophical contributions to the human race and the human conditions

38
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:14,240
have advanced so much. I mean, we're still taking guidance and admiring Aristotle and Plato and

39
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:22,480
Seneca and the like. And on the other hand, if you think about what has made the human condition

40
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:34,080
better, fire, water, harnessing of wind energy, try to row across an ocean, right? Not easy.

41
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:39,680
And for people who are just listening or watching, there's a beautiful sexy ship from

42
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,080
16th, 17th century?

43
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:48,960
This is a 19th century handmade model of a 17th century sailing ship, which is of the type that

44
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:56,080
the Dutch East India's company used to sail the world and trade. So that was made, you know,

45
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:01,920
the original is made sometime in the 1600s. And then this model is made in the 19th

46
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,320
century by individuals.

47
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,320
So both the model and the ship itself is engineering at its best. And just imagine,

48
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:13,760
just like rockets flying out to space, how much hope this filled people with exploring the unknown,

49
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:20,640
going into the mystery. Both the entrepreneurs and the business people and the engineers and

50
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:24,320
just humans, what's out there? What's out there to be discovered?

51
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:29,440
Yeah, the metaphor of human beings leaving shore or sailing across the horizon,

52
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,520
risking their lives in pursuit of a better life is an incredibly powerful one.

53
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:42,000
In 1900, I suppose the average life expectancy is 50. During the Revolutionary War, you know,

54
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,960
while our founding fathers were fighting to establish, you know, life, liberty, pursuit

55
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:53,760
of happiness, the Constitution, average life expectancy of like 32, something between 32 and

56
00:05:53,760 --> 00:06:01,360
36. So all the sound and the fury doesn't make you live past 32, but what does, right? Antibiotics.

57
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:08,080
Conquest of infectious diseases. If we understand the science of infectious disease, you know,

58
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:15,600
sterilizing a knife and harnessing antibiotics gets you from 50 to 70. And that happened fast,

59
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:24,320
right? That happens from 1900 to 1950 or something like that. And I think if you look at the human

60
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:33,600
condition, you ever get on one of those rowing machines where they actually keep track of your

61
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,680
watts output when you're on that? Yeah.

62
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:45,760
Yeah, it's like 200 is a lot. Okay, 200 is a lot. So a kilowatt hour is like all the energy that a

63
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:54,240
trained athlete can deliver in a day. And probably not 1% of the people in the world could deliver

64
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,840
a kilowatt hour in a day. And the commercial value of a kilowatt hour, the retail value,

65
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:09,280
is 11 cents today. And the wholesale value is 2 cents. And so you have to look at the contribution

66
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,960
of politicians and philosophers and economists to the human condition. And it's like at best

67
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,920
a wash one way or the other. And then if you look at the contribution of John D. Rockefeller

68
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:30,720
when he delivered you a barrel of oil, the energy in oil, liquid energy, or the contribution of

69
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:38,880
Tesla as we deliver electricity. And what's the impact on the human condition if I have

70
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:47,200
electric power, if I have chemical power, if I have wind energy, if I can actually set up a

71
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:54,720
reservoir, create a dam, spin a turbine, and generate energy from a hydraulic source?

72
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:04,240
That's extraordinary, right? And so our ability to cross the ocean, our ability to grow food,

73
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:12,960
our ability to live, it's technology that gets the human race from a brutal life where life

74
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:21,760
expectancy is 30 to a world where life expectancy is 80. You gave a D-minus to the economists.

75
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:27,120
So are they too like the politicians to wash in terms of there's good ideas and bad ideas and

76
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:35,440
that tiny delta between good and bad is how you squeak past the F-plus onto the D-minus territory?

77
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:46,240
RL I think most economic ideas are bad ideas. Take us back to MIT and you want to solve a fluid

78
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:53,040
dynamics problem. Design the shape of the hull of that ship. Or you want to design an airfoil,

79
00:08:53,040 --> 00:09:02,560
a wing. Or if you want to design an engine or a nozzle in a rocket ship, you wouldn't do it with

80
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:07,600
simple arithmetic. You wouldn't do it with a scalar. There's not a single number, right? It's

81
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:16,320
vector math. Computational fluid dynamics is n-dimensional, higher-level math, complicated

82
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:23,600
stuff. So when an economist says the inflation rate is 2%, that's a scalar. And when an economist

83
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:29,680
says it's not a problem to print more money because the velocity of the money is very low,

84
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:36,880
the monetary velocity is low, that's another scalar. Okay, so the truth of the matter is

85
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:44,480
inflation is not a scalar. Inflation is an n-dimensional vector. Money velocity is not

86
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:54,720
a scalar. Saying what's the velocity of money, oh, it's slow or it's fast, it ignores the question

87
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:01,760
of what medium is the money moving through. In the same way that what's the speed of sound?

88
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:11,760
Okay, well, what is sound, right? Sound is a compression wave, it's energy moving through

89
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,640
a medium, but the speed is different. So for example, the speed of sound through air is

90
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,760
different than the speed of sound through water. And sound moves faster through water. It moves

91
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,480
faster through a solid and it moves faster through a stiffer solid. So there isn't one.

92
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:32,160
TG What is the fundamental problem with the way economists reduce the world down to a model?

93
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:37,360
Is it too simple or is it just even the first principles of constructing the model is wrong?

94
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:44,880
RL I think that the fundamental problem is if you see the world as a scalar, you simply pick

95
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:52,960
the one number which is, which supports whatever you want to do and you ignore the universe of

96
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:58,880
other consequences from your behavior. TG In general, I don't know if you've heard of,

97
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:04,560
like Eric Weisen has been talking about this with gauge theory. So different kinds of approaches

98
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:12,720
from the physics world, from the mathematical world to extend past this scalar view of economics.

99
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:20,080
So gauge theory is one way that comes from physics. Do you find that a way of exploring economics

100
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:24,320
interesting? So outside of cryptocurrency, outside of the actual technologies and so on,

101
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,320
just analysis of how economics works, do you find that interesting?

102
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:35,920
RL Yeah, I think that if we're going to want to really make any scientific progress in economics,

103
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:42,960
we have to apply much, much more computationally intensive and richer forms of mathematics.

104
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,720
TG So simulation, perhaps? Or...

105
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:50,480
RL Yeah, you know, when I was at MIT, I studied system dynamics. You know, they taught it at the

106
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:59,280
Sloan School. It was developed by Jay Forrester, who was an extraordinary computer scientist.

107
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:06,560
And when we've created models of economic behavior, they were all multi-dimensional

108
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:13,440
nonlinear models. So if you want to describe how anything works in the real world, you have to

109
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:19,920
start with the concept of feedback. If I double the price of something, demand will fall and

110
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:28,000
attempts to create supply will increase, and there will be a delay before the capacity increases.

111
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,440
There'll be an instant demand change, and there'll be rippling effects throughout every other segment

112
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:38,720
of the economy downstream and upstream of such a thing. So it's kind of common sense,

113
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:45,280
but most economics, most classical economics, is always, you know, taught with linear models,

114
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:51,840
you know, fairly simplistic linear models. And oftentimes, I'm really shocked today

115
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:59,040
that the entire mainstream dialogue of economics has been captured by scale or arithmetic.

116
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:06,080
For example, if you read, you know, read any article in the New York Times or the Wall Street

117
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:12,160
Journal, right, they just refer to it, there's an inflation number or the CPI or the inflation rate

118
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:20,160
is X. And if you look at all the historic studies of the impact of inflation, generally, they're

119
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:27,680
all based upon the idea that inflation equals CPI, and then they try to extrapolate from that,

120
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:35,200
and you just get nowhere with it. So at the very least, we should be considering inflation

121
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:41,920
and other economics concepts as a nonlinear dynamical system. So nonlinearity and also just

122
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:46,480
embracing the full complexity of just how the variables interact, maybe through simulation,

123
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,080
maybe some have some interesting models around that.

124
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:55,760
Wouldn't it be refreshing if somebody for once published a table of the change in price of every

125
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:00,480
product, every service, and every asset in every place over time?

126
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:04,400
You said table, some of that also is the task of visualization,

127
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:13,200
how to extract from this complex set of numbers patterns that somehow indicate something

128
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:18,720
fundamental about what's happening. So like, summarization of data is still important,

129
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:25,280
perhaps summarization not down to a single scale of value, but looking at that whole sea of numbers,

130
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:33,680
you have to find patterns, like what is inflation in a particular sector, what is maybe a change

131
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:39,600
over time, maybe different geographical regions, you know, things of that nature. I think that's

132
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:45,680
kind of, I don't know even what that task is. You could look at machine learning, you can look

133
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:51,600
at AI with that perspective, which is like, how do you represent what's happening efficiently,

134
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,800
as efficiently as possible? That's never going to be a single number, but it might be a compressed

135
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:01,280
model that captures something beautiful, something fundamental about what's happening.

136
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:12,240
SF. It's an opportunity, for sure. If we take, for example, during the pandemic,

137
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:20,720
the response of the political apparatus was to lower interest rates to zero and to start

138
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:26,800
buying assets, in essence printing money, and the defense was there's no inflation.

139
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:33,360
But of course, you had one part of the economy where it was locked down, so it was illegal to

140
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:41,600
buy anything. It was either illegal or it was impractical, so it would be impossible for demand

141
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:47,600
to manifest, so of course there is no inflation. On the other hand, there was instantaneous,

142
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:54,560
immediate inflation in another part of the economy. For example, you lower the interest

143
00:15:54,560 --> 00:16:01,360
rates to zero. At one point, we saw the swap rate on a 30-year note go to 72 basis points.

144
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:08,960
That means that the value of a long-dated bond immediately inflates, so the bond market had

145
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:17,920
hyperinflation within minutes of these financial decisions. The asset market had hyperinflation.

146
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:24,160
We had what you call a K-shape recovery, what we affectionately call a K-shape recovery. Main Street

00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:30,240
shut down, Wall Street recovered all within six weeks. The inflation was in the assets,

148
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:38,880
like in the stocks, in the bonds. If you look today, you see that typical house,

149
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:47,760
according to the Case-Schiller Index today, is up 19.2% year over year. If you're a first-time home

150
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:59,520
buyer, the inflation rate is 19%. The formal CPI announced a 7.9%. You can pretty much create any

151
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:06,720
inflation rate you want by constructing a market basket, a weighted basket of products or services

152
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:14,400
or assets that yield you the answer. I think that the fundamental failing of economists is,

153
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:22,320
first of all, they don't really have a term for asset inflation, right?

154
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:28,480
What's an asset? What's asset hyperinflation? You mentioned bond market swap rate and asset

155
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:35,040
is where the majority of the hyperinflation happened. What's inflation? What's hyperinflation

156
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:40,800
and what's an asset? What's an asset market? I'm going to ask so many dumb questions.

157
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:48,880
In the conventional economic world, you would treat inflation as the rate of increase in price

158
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:54,080
of a market basket of consumer products defined by a government agency.

159
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,320
So they have like traditional things that a regular consumer would be buying.

160
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:09,920
The government selects like toilet paper, food, toaster, electronics, all that kind of stuff. And

161
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:18,320
it's like a representative basket of goods that lead to a content existence on this earth for

162
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:24,240
regular consumer. They define a synthetic metric, right? I mean, I'm going to say you should have

163
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:31,280
a thousand square foot apartment and you should have a used car and you should eat, you know,

164
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:38,240
three hamburgers a week. Now, ten years go by and the apartment costs more, I could adjust the

165
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:43,600
market basket via, you know, they call them hedonic adjustments. I could decide that it

166
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:50,080
used to be in 1970 to a thousand square feet, but in the year 2020, you only need 700 square

167
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:56,640
feet because we've miniaturized televisions and we've got more efficient electric appliances

168
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:01,280
because things have collapsed into the iPhone. You just don't need as much space. So now I,

169
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:06,240
you know, it may be that the apartment costs 50% more, but after the hedonic adjustment,

170
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:11,360
there is no inflation because I just downgraded the expectation of what a normal person should

171
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:16,480
have. So the synthetic nature of the metric allows for manipulation by people in power.

172
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:24,720
RL. Pretty much. I guess my criticism of economists is rather than embracing inflation

173
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:31,680
based upon its fundamental idea, which is the rate at which the price of things go up, right?

174
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:41,440
They've been captured by mainstream conventional thinking to immediately equate inflation to

175
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:49,200
the government-issued CPI or government-issued PCE or government-issued PPI measure, which was never

176
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:56,480
the rate at which things go up. It's simply the rate at which a synthetic basket of products and

177
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:03,680
services the government wishes to track go up. Now, the problem with that is two big things.

178
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:09,440
One thing is the government gets to create the market basket and so they keep changing what's

179
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:17,440
in the basket over time. So, I mean, if I said three years ago, you should go see 10 concerts

180
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:23,200
a year and the concert tickets now cost $200 each. Now it's $2,000 a year to go see concerts.

181
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,840
Now I'm in charge of calculating inflation. So I redefine, you know, your entertainment quota for

182
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:36,000
the year to be eight Netflix streaming concerts. And now they don't cost $2,000. They cost nothing

183
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,680
and there is no inflation, but you don't get your concerts, right? So the problem starts with

184
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:49,360
continually changing the definition of the market basket. But in my opinion, that's not the biggest

185
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:59,200
problem. The more egregious problem is the fundamental idea that assets aren't products

186
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,680
or services. Assets can't be inflated. What's an asset?

187
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:15,360
A house, a share of Apple stock, a bond, a Bitcoin is an asset or a Picasso painting.

188
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:22,400
Not a consumable good, not an apple that you can eat.

189
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:30,400
Right. If I throw away an asset, then I'm not on the hook to track the inflation rate for it. So

190
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:35,600
what happens if I change the policy such that, let's take the classic example, a million dollar

191
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:42,080
bond at a 5% interest rate gives you $50,000 a year in risk-free income. You might retire on

192
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:49,120
$50,000 a year in a low cost jurisdiction. So the cost of social security or early retirement is

193
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:56,640
$1 million when the interest rate is 5%. During the crisis of March of 2020, the interest rate

194
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:03,200
went on a 10-year bond, went to 50 basis points. So now the cost of that bond is $10 million.

195
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:10,400
The cost of social security went from a million dollars to $10 million. So if you wanted to work

196
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:16,880
your entire life, save money, and then retire risk-free and live happily ever after on a $50,000

197
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:23,680
salary, live in on a beach in Mexico, wherever you wanted to go, you had hyperinflation. The cost of

198
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:31,200
your aspiration increased by a factor of 10 over the course of some amount of time. In fact, in

199
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:36,880
that case, that was over the course of about 12 years. As the inflation rate ground down, the

200
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:45,440
asset traded up. But the conventional view is, oh, that's not a problem because it's good that

201
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:53,040
assets, it's good that the bond is highly priced because we own the bond. Or what's the problem

202
00:22:53,040 --> 00:23:00,000
with the inflation rate in housing being 19%? It's an awful problem for a 22-year-old that's starting

203
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,920
their first job, that's saving money to buy a house. But it would be characterized as a benefit

204
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:12,720
to society by a conventional economist who would say, well, housing asset values are higher because

205
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:18,960
of interest rate fluctuation, and now the economy has got more wealth. And so that's viewed as a

206
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:29,520
benefit. So what's being missed here? The suffering of the average person or the struggle, the

207
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:35,680
suffering, the pain of the average person, like metrics that captured that within the economic

208
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:43,040
system. Is it when you talk about- One way to say it is a conventional view of inflation as CPI

209
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:52,880
understates the human misery that's inflicted upon the working class and on mainstream companies

210
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:01,440
by the political class. And so it's a massive shift of wealth from the working class to the

211
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:09,040
property class. It's a massive shift of power from the free market to the centrally governed

212
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:14,320
or the controlled market. It's a massive shift of power from the people to the government.

213
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:22,960
And maybe one more illustrative point here, Alexis, is what do you think the inflation

214
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:27,680
rate's been for the past 100 years? Oh, you're talking about the scalar again?

215
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:32,560
If you took a survey of everybody on the street and you asked them what do they think inflation

216
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:40,720
was? What is it? You remember when Jerome Powell said our target's 2% but we're not there? If you

217
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:50,960
go around the corner, I have posted the deed to this house sold in 1930. Okay. And the number

218
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:58,720
on that deed is $100,000, 1930. And if you go on Zillow and you get the Z estimate-

219
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,160
Is it higher than that? No.

220
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:15,840
$30,500,000. So that's 92 years, 1930 or 2022, and in 92 years we've had 305x increase in price

221
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:22,320
of the house. Now, if you actually back calculate, you come to a conclusion that the inflation rate

222
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:33,280
was approximately 6.5% a year every year for 92 years. Okay. And there's nobody in government,

223
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:39,840
no conventional economists that would ever admit to an inflation rate of 7% a year in the US dollar

224
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:48,800
over the last century. Now, if you dig deeper, one guy that's done a great job working on this

225
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:54,800
is Seyfettin Amos who wrote the book The Bitcoin Standard. And he notes that on average, it looks

226
00:25:54,800 --> 00:26:01,520
like the inflation rate and the money supply is about 7% a year all the way up to the year 2020.

227
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:07,680
If you look at the S&P index, which is a market basket of scarce desirable stocks,

228
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:17,200
it returned about 10%. If you talk to 10% a year for 100 years, the money supply is expanding at

229
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:23,360
7% a hundred years. If you actually talk to economists or you look at the economy and you

230
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:30,400
ask the question, how fast does the economy grow in its entirety year over year? Generally about

231
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:37,200
two to 3%. Like the sum total impact of all this technology and human ingenuity might get you a

232
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:43,520
two and a half, 3% improvement a year. As measured by GDP. Are you okay with that?

233
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:50,400
I'm not sure I'd go that far yet, but I would just say that if you had the human race doing stuff,

234
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:56,720
and if you ask the question, how much more efficiently will we do the stuff next year

235
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:03,120
than this year? Or what's the value of all of our innovations and inventions and investments

236
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:10,640
in the past 12 months? You'd be hard pressed to say we get 2% better. Typical investor thinks

237
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:17,680
they're 10% better every year. So if you look at what's going on, really, when you're holding a

238
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:23,680
million dollars of stocks and you're getting a 10% gain a year, you really get a 7% expansion

239
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:31,440
of the money supply. You're getting a two or 3% gain under best circumstances. And another way to

240
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:38,800
say that is if the money supply stopped expanding at 7% a year, the S&P yield might be 3% and not

241
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:46,560
10%. It probably should be. Now, that gets you to start to ask a bunch of other fundamental

242
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:53,040
questions. Like if I borrow a billion dollars and pay 3% interest and the money supply expands

243
00:27:53,040 --> 00:28:00,880
at 7% to 10% a year, and I ended up making a 10% return on a billion dollar investment,

244
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:10,240
paying 3% interest, is that fair? And who suffered so that I could do that? Because in an environment

245
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:15,840
where you're just inflating the money supply and you're holding the assets constant, it stands the

246
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:22,080
reason that the price of all the assets is going to appreciate somewhat proportional to the money

247
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:28,160
supply. And the difference in asset appreciations is going to be a function of the scarce desirable

248
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:34,640
quality of the assets. And to what extent can I make more of them? And to what extent are they

249
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:42,480
truly limited in supply? Yeah. So we'll get to a lot of the words you said there, the scarcity

250
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:50,880
and so connected to how limited they are and the value of those assets. But you also said,

251
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:57,760
so the expansion of the money supply, which is put another way is printing money. And so is that

252
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:04,000
always bad, the expansion of the money supply? Just to put some terms on the table so we understand

253
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:12,000
them. You nonchalantly say it's always on average expanding every year, the money supply is expanding

254
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:19,280
every year by 7%. That's a bad thing? That's universally a bad thing? It's awful. I guess to

255
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:29,680
be precise, it's the currency. I would say money is monetary energy or economic energy.

256
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:36,320
And the economic energy has to find its way into a medium. So if you want to move it rapidly as a

257
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:40,880
medium of exchange has to find its way into currency. But the money can also flow into

258
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:49,600
property, like a house or gold. If the money flows into property, it'll probably hold its value much

259
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:56,400
better if the money flows into currency, right? If you had put $100,000 in this house, you would

260
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:03,200
have 305X return over 92 years. But if you had put the money, $100,000 in a safe deposit box and

261
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:11,280
buried it in the basement, you would have lost 99.7% of your wealth over the same time period.

262
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:20,720
So the expansion of the currency creates a massive inefficiency in the society, what I'll call an

263
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:28,800
adiabatic lapse. What we're doing is we're bleeding the civilization to death, right?

264
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,880
What's the adiabatic, what's that word?

265
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,880
Adiabatic lapse.

266
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,600
Adiabatic.

267
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:39,520
Right? In aerospace engineering, you want to solve any problem, they start with the phrase,

268
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:47,040
assume an adiabatic system. And what that means is a closed system. So I've got a container

269
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:52,320
and in that container, no air leaves and no air enters, no energy exits or enters,

270
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,680
so it's a closed system.

271
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,320
So you got the closed system lapse.

272
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:00,560
Okay. Okay. I'm going to use a-

273
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,920
There's a leak in the ship.

274
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:06,640
I'm going to use a physical metaphor for you because you're the jujitsu, right? Like you've

275
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:13,520
got 10 pints of blood in your body. And so before your next workout, I'm going to take one pint from

276
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:21,840
you. Now you're going to go exercise, but you've lost 10% of your blood. Okay? You're not going to

277
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:27,600
perform as well. It takes about one month for your body to replace the red blood platelets.

278
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,720
So what if I tell you every month you got to show up and I'm going to bleed you?

279
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,680
Yeah.

280
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:38,800
Okay. So if I'm draining the energy, I'm draining the blood from your body, you can't perform.

281
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:44,400
If you, adiabatic lapse is when you go up an altitude, every thousand feet, you lose three

282
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:51,440
degrees. You go 50,000 feet, you're 150 degrees colder than sea level. That's why you look at

283
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:58,720
your instruments and instead of 80 degrees, you're minus 70 degrees. Why is the temperature falling?

284
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:04,320
Temperature is falling because it's not a closed system. It's an open system. As the air expands,

285
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:15,840
the density falls, right? The energy per cubic whatever falls and therefore the temperature

286
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:21,760
falls, right? The heat's falling out of the solution. So when you're inflating,

287
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:28,240
let's say you're inflating the currency supply by 6%, you're sucking 6% of the energy

288
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:34,480
out of the fluid that the economy is using to function.

289
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:39,680
So the currency, this kind of ocean of currency, that's a nice way for the economy to function.

290
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:44,720
It's the most kind of, it's being inefficient when you expand the money supply, but it's

291
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:52,960
the liquid. I'm trying to find the right kind of adjective here. It's how you do transactions

292
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:59,840
at a scale of billions. Currency is the asset we use to move monetary energy around and you

293
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:05,440
could use the dollar or you could use the peso or you could use the bolivar. Selling houses and

294
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:13,440
buying houses is much more inefficient. Or like you can't transact between billions of people

295
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:20,000
with houses. Yeah. Properties don't make such good mediums of exchange. They make better stores

296
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:27,920
of value and they have utility value if it's a ship or a house or a plane or a bushel of corn,

297
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:33,840
right? Can I zoom out just for, can we zoom out? Keep zooming out until we reach the origin of

298
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:40,720
human civilization, but on the way, ask, you gave economists a D minus. I'm not even going to ask

299
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:49,200
what you give to governments. Do you think their failure, economists and government failure is

300
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:58,800
malevolence or incompetence? I think policymakers are well-intentioned, but generally all government

301
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:04,800
policy is inflationary. It's inflammatory and inflationary. So what I mean by that is

302
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:13,920
when you have a policy pursuing supply chain independence, if you have an energy policy,

303
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:20,960
if you have a labor policy, if you have a trade policy, if you have any kind of foreign policy,

304
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:28,400
a domestic policy, a manufacturing policy, every one of these, a medical policy, every one of these

305
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:37,440
policies interferes with the free market and generally prevents some rational actor from doing

306
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:43,440
it in a cheaper, more efficient way. So when you layer them on top of each other, they all have to

307
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:48,880
be paid for. If you want to shut down the entire economy for a year, you have to pay for it,

308
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:54,400
right? If you want to fight a war, you have to pay for it, right? If you don't want to use oil

309
00:34:54,400 --> 00:35:00,480
or natural gas, you have to pay for it. If you don't want to manufacture semiconductors in China

310
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:05,440
and you want to manufacture them in the US, you got to pay for it. If I rebuild the entire supply

311
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:10,640
chain in Pennsylvania and I hire a bunch of employees and then I unionize the employees,

312
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:18,640
then not only am I, I idle the factory in the Far East, it goes to 50% capacity. So

313
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:24,400
whatever it sells, it has to raise the price on. And then I drive up the cost of labor for every

314
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:30,880
other manufacturer in the US because I'm competing against them, right? I'm changing that condition. So

315
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,920
everything gets less efficient, everything gets more expensive. And of course, the government

316
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:43,600
couldn't really pay for its policies and its wars with taxes. We didn't pay for World War I with tax.

317
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:47,840
We didn't pay for World War II with tax. We didn't pay for Vietnam with tax. In fact,

318
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:53,680
when you trace this, what you realize is the government never pays for all of its policies

319
00:35:53,680 --> 00:36:00,080
with taxes. Because it's too painful to ask to raise the taxes to truly transparently pay for

320
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:05,680
the things you're doing with taxes, with taxpayer money, because they feel the pain. That's one

321
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:12,400
interpretation or it's just too transparent. If people understood the true cost-

322
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,120
Of war, they wouldn't want to go to war.

323
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:22,960
If you were told that you would lose 95% of your assets, you know, and 90% of everything you will

324
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:30,000
be ever will be taken from you, you might reprioritize your thought about a given policy

325
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,760
and you might not vote for that politician. But you're still saying incompetence,

326
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:39,680
not malevolence. So fundamentally, government creates a bureaucracy of incompetence,

327
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:48,000
is kind of how you look at it. I think a lack of humility, like if people

328
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,200
had more humility, then they would realize- Humility about how little they know,

329
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,800
how little they understand about the function of complex systems.

330
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,840
There's a phrase from Quanese to his movie Unforgiven, where he says,

331
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:06,560
a man's got to know his limitations. I think that a lot of people overestimate

332
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:17,600
what they can accomplish and experience. Experience in life causes you to re-evaluate that.

333
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:24,000
So I mean, I've done a lot of things in my life and generally, my mistakes were always

334
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:31,840
my good ideas that I enthusiastically pursued to the detriment of my great ideas that required

335
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:40,080
150% of my attention to prosper. So I think people pursue too many good ideas. They all

336
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:47,440
sound good, but there's just a limit to what you can accomplish. And everybody underestimates

337
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:56,800
the challenges of implementing an idea. And they always overestimate the benefits

338
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:03,760
of the pursuit of that. And so I think it's an overconfidence that causes an overexuberance

339
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:11,600
in pursuit of policies. And as the ambition of the government expands, so must the currency supply.

340
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,600
I could say the money supply, but let's say the currency supply.

341
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:23,600
You can triple the number of pesos in the economy, but it doesn't triple the amount of

342
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:29,040
manufacturing capacity in the said economy. And it doesn't triple the amount of assets

343
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:34,640
in the economy, it just triples the pesos. So as you increase the currency supply,

344
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:41,600
then the price of all those scarce desirable things will tend to go up rapidly.

345
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:49,280
And the confidence of all of the institutions, the corporations, and the individual actors

346
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,560
and trading partners will collapse.

347
00:38:52,560 --> 00:39:00,240
LW. If we take a tangent on a tangent, and we will return soon to the big human civilization question.

348
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:08,560
So if government naturally wants to buy stuff it can't afford,

349
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:17,840
what's the best form of government? Anarchism, libertarianism. So not even,

350
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:22,480
there's not even armies, there's no borders, that's anarchism.

351
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,120
RL. The least.

352
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:26,720
LW. The smallest possible. The smallest possible.

353
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:31,440
RL. The best government would be the least, and the debate will be over that.

354
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:36,240
LW. When you think about this stuff, do you think about, okay, government is the way it is. I,

355
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:42,080
as a person that can generate great ideas, how do I operate in this world? Or do you also think

356
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:47,840
about the big picture, if we start a new civilization somewhere on Mars, do you think

357
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:53,200
about what's the ultimate form of government? What's at least a promising thing to try?

358
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:06,000
RL. You know, I have laser eyes on my profile on Twitter, Lex.

359
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,280
LW. What does that mean?

360
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:13,440
RL. And the significance of laser eyes is to focus on the thing that can make a difference.

361
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:24,240
And if I look at the civilization, I would say half the problems in the civilization

362
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:29,680
are due to the fact that our understanding of economics and money is defective.

363
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:39,520
Half. 50%. I don't know, it's worth $500 trillion worth of problems. Like, money represents all the

364
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:46,240
economic energy in the civilization, and it kind of equates to all the products, all the services,

365
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:51,920
and all the assets that we have and we're ever gonna have. So that's half. The other half of

366
00:40:51,920 --> 00:41:01,120
the problems in the civilization are medical and military and political and philosophical

367
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:10,960
and natural. And I think that there are a lot of different solutions to all those problems,

368
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:19,760
and they are all honorable professions, and they all merit a lifetime of consideration

369
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:27,440
for the specialists in all those areas. I think that what I could offer that's constructive is

370
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:36,320
inflation is completely misunderstood. It's a much bigger problem than we understand it to be.

371
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:42,000
We need to introduce engineering and science techniques into economics if we want to further

372
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:49,840
the human condition. All government policy is inflationary. And another pernicious myth

373
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:57,920
is inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomena. A famous quote by Milton Friedman,

374
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:02,240
I believe, it's like, it's a monetary phenomena, that is inflation comes from expanding the

375
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:08,560
currency supply. It's a nice phrase, and it's oftentimes quoted by people that are anti-inflation,

376
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:13,680
but again, it just signifies a lack of appreciation of what the issue is.

377
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:22,240
If I had a currency which was completely non-inflationary, if I never printed another

378
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:26,800
dollar, and if I eliminated fractional reserve banking from the face of the earth,

379
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:34,560
we'd still have inflation. And we have inflation as long as we have government that is capable of

380
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:42,400
pursuing any kind of policies that are in themself inflationary, and generally they all are.

381
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:49,840
So in general, inflationary is the big characteristic of human nature that

382
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:54,560
government's collection of groups that have power over others and allocate other people's resources

383
00:42:55,680 --> 00:43:03,600
will try to intentionally or not hide the costs of those allocations. Like in some

384
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:11,920
some tricky ways, whatever the options are available. Hiding the cost is like the tertiary

385
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:21,280
thing. The primary goal is the government will attempt to do good. That's the primary problem?

386
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:28,400
They will attempt to do good, and they will do good imperfectly, and they will create oftentimes

387
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:34,480
as much damage, more damage than the good they do. Most government policy will be iatrogenic.

388
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:38,960
It will create more harm than good in the pursuit of it, but it is what it is.

389
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:48,400
The secondary issue is they will unintentionally pay for it by expanding the currency supply

390
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:58,560
without realizing that they're actually paying for it in a suboptimal fashion.

391
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:04,320
They'll collapse their own currencies while they attempt to do good. The tertiary issue is

392
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:10,480
they will mismeasure how badly they're collapsing the currency. So for example, if you go to the

393
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:16,080
Bureau of Labor Statistics and look at the numbers printed by the Fed, they'll say,

394
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:22,080
oh, it looks like the dollar has lost 95% of its purchasing power over 100 years. Okay,

395
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:27,680
they sort of fess up that there's a problem, but they make it 95% loss over 100 years. What they

396
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:36,480
don't do is realize it's a 99.7% loss over 80 years. So they will mismeasure just the horrific

397
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:45,200
extent of the monetary policy in pursuit of the foreign policy and the domestic policy,

398
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:54,720
which they overestimate their budget and their means to accomplish their ends, and they

399
00:44:54,720 --> 00:45:02,880
underestimate the cost. And they're oblivious to the horrific damage that they do to the

400
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:10,080
civilization because the mental models that they use that are conventionally taught are wrong,

401
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:16,000
right? The mental model that, like, it's okay, we can print all this money because the velocity of

402
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:23,360
the money is low, right? Because money velocity is a scalar and inflation is the scalar, and we

403
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:28,960
don't see 2% inflation yet and the money velocity is low, and so it's okay if we print trillions of

404
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:36,400
dollars. Well, the money velocity was immediate, right? The velocity of money through the crypto

405
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:45,920
economy is 10,000 times faster than the velocity of money through the consumer economy, right? I

406
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:50,480
think Nick pointed out when you spoke to him, he said it takes two months for a credit card

407
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:56,160
transaction to settle, right? So you want to spend a million dollars in the consumer economy,

408
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:02,480
you can move it six times a year. You put a million dollars into gold, gold will sit in a

409
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:09,280
vault for a decade, okay? So the velocity of money through gold is 0.1. You put the money in the stock

410
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:14,080
market and you can trade it once a week, the settlement is T plus 2, maybe you get to 2 to

411
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:20,960
1 leverage. You might get to a money velocity of 100 a year in the stock market. You put your money

412
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:27,840
into the crypto economy and these people are settling every four hours. And if you're offshore,

413
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:34,480
they're trading with 20x leverage. So if you settle every day and you trade with 20x leverage,

414
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:44,160
you just went to 7,000. So the velocity of the money varies. I think the politicians,

415
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:49,440
they don't really understand inflation and they don't understand economics, but you can't blame

416
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:55,760
them because the economists don't understand economics. Because if they did, they would be

417
00:46:55,760 --> 00:47:04,160
creating multivariate computer simulations where they actually put in the price of every piece of

418
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:09,600
housing in every city in the world, the full array of foods, and the full array of products,

419
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:16,320
and the full array of assets. And then on a monthly basis, they would publish all those

420
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:24,000
results. And that's a high bandwidth requirement. And I think that people don't really want to

421
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:32,880
embrace it. And also, the most pernicious thing, there's that phrase, you can't tell people what

422
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:38,800
to think, but you can tell them what to think about. The most pernicious thing is, I get you

423
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:47,920
to misunderstand the phenomena so that even when it's happening to you, you don't appreciate that

424
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:53,440
it's a bad thing and you think it's a good thing. So if housing prices are going up 20% year over

425
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:57,920
year and I say, this is great for the American public because most of them are homeowners,

426
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:08,000
then I have misrepresented a phenomena. Inflation is 20%, not 7%. And then I have misrepresented it

427
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:15,200
as being a positive rather than a negative. And people will stare at it and you could even show

428
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:20,880
them their house on fire and they would perceive it as being great because it's warming them up

429
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:25,920
and they're going to save on their heat cost. It does seem that the cruder the model, whether

430
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:32,880
it's economics or their psychology, the easier it is to weave whatever the heck narrative you want

431
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:42,160
and not in a malicious way, but just like it's some kind of emergent phenomena, this narrative

432
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:46,960
thing that we tell ourselves. So you can tell any kind of story about inflation. Inflation is good,

433
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:51,520
inflation is bad. The cruder the model, the easier it is to tell a narrative about it.

434
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:58,880
So if you take an engineering approach, I feel like it becomes more and more difficult

435
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:04,960
to run away from a true deep understanding of the dynamics of the system.

436
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:10,480
I mean, honestly, if you went to a hundred people on the street and you asked them to define

437
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:18,640
inflation, how many would say it's a vector tracking the change in price of every product

438
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:26,240
service asset in the world over time? Not many. Now, if you went to them and you said,

439
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:32,800
do you think 2% inflation a year is good or bad? The majority would probably say,

440
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:38,640
well, I hear it's good. The majority of economists would say 2% inflation a year is good.

441
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:49,200
And of course, look at the ship next to us. What if I told you that the ship leaked 2% of its

442
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:54,880
volume every something, right? The ship is rotting 2% a year. That means the useful life of the ship

443
00:49:54,880 --> 00:50:01,440
is 50 years. Now, ironically, that's true. Like a wooden ship had a 50 year to a hundred year life,

444
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:07,280
100 would be long, 50 years, not unlikely. So when we built ships out of wood, they had a useful

445
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:14,480
life of about 50 years and then they sunk, they rotted. There's nothing good about it, right? You

446
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:22,720
build a ship out of steel and it's zero as opposed to 2% degradation. And how much better is 0%

447
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:33,360
versus 2%? Well, 2% means you have a useful life of, it's half-life of 35 years. 2% is a half-life

448
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:38,320
of 35 years. That's basically the half-life of money and gold. If I store your life force in

449
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:46,000
gold, under perfect circumstances, you have a useful life of 35 years. 0% is a useful life of

450
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:57,120
forever. So 0% is immortal. 2% is 35 years average life expectancy. So the idea that you would think

451
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:02,000
the life expectancy of the currency and the civilization should be 35 years instead of

452
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:09,520
forever is kind of a silly notion. But the tragic notion is it was, you know, 7 into 7,

453
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:17,360
or 10 years. The money has had a half-life of 10 years, except for the fact that in weak societies

454
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:24,400
in Argentina or the like, the half-life of the money is three to four years, in Venezuela,

455
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:32,080
one year. So the United States dollar and the United States economic system was the most

456
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:38,160
successful economic system in the last 100 years in the world. We won every war. We were the world's

457
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:46,320
superpower. Our currency lost 99.7% of its value. And that means, horrifically, every other currency

458
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:53,920
lost everything. In essence, the other ones were 99.9%, except for most that were 100% because they

459
00:51:53,920 --> 00:52:04,480
all completely failed. And you've got a mainstream economic community that thinks that inflation is

460
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:13,600
a number and 2% is desirable. It's kind of like, you know, remember George Washington? You know

461
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:23,520
how he died? Well-meaning physicians bled him to death. Okay, the last thing in the world you would

462
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:30,480
want to do to a sick person is bleed them, right? In the modern world, I think we understand that

463
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:43,360
oxygen is carried by the blood cells. And there's that triage phrase, what's the first thing you do

464
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:49,680
in an injury? Stop the bleeding. Single first thing, right? You show up after any accident,

465
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:54,480
I look at you, stop the bleeding because you're going to be dead in a matter of minutes if you

466
00:52:54,480 --> 00:53:02,640
bleed out. So it strikes me as being ironic that orthodox conventional wisdom was bleed the patient

467
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:08,080
to death. And this was the most important patient in the country, maybe in the history of the

468
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:15,120
country, and we bled him to death trying to help him. So when you're actually inflating the money

469
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:22,240
supply at 7%, but you're calling it 2% because you want to help the economy, you're literally

470
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:29,360
bleeding the free market to death. But the sad fact is George Washington went along with it

471
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:36,480
because he thought that they were going to do him good. And the majority of the society,

472
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:44,960
most companies, most conventional thinkers, you know, the working class, they go along with this

473
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:49,600
because they think that someone has their best interests at mind and the people that are bleeding

474
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:55,600
them to death believe, they believe that prescription because their mental models are

475
00:53:55,600 --> 00:54:04,960
just so defective. And their understanding of energy and engineering and the economics that

476
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:11,760
are at play is crippled by these mental models. But that's both the bug in the future of human

477
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:16,720
civilization, that ideas take hold, they unite us, we believe in them,

478
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:26,160
and we make a lot of cool stuff happen by, as an average, sort of, just the fact of the matter,

479
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:31,600
a lot of people believe the same thing, they get together, and they get some shit done because

480
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:36,960
they believe that thing. And then some ideas can be really bad and really destructive,

481
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:43,280
but on average, the ideas seem to be progressing in a direction of good. Let me just step back.

482
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:49,440
What the hell are we doing here, us humans on this earth? How do you think of humans? How special

483
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:56,880
are humans? How did human civilization originate on this earth? And what is this human project

484
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:03,760
that we're all taking on? You mentioned fire and water and apparently bleeding you to death is not

485
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:09,360
a good idea. I always thought you can get the demons out in that way, but that was a recent

486
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:19,520
invention. So what's this thing we're doing here? I think what distinguishes human beings from

487
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:27,600
all the other creatures on the earth is our ability to engineer. We're engineers, right?

488
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:35,120
To solve problems or just build incredible cool things? Engineering,

489
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:41,840
harnessing energy and technique to make the world a better place than you found it, right?

490
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:48,320
But from the point that we actually started to play with fire, right? That was a big leap forward.

491
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:57,840
Harnessing the power of kinetic energy and missiles, another step forward. Every city

492
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:07,440
built on water. Why water? Well, water is bringing energy, right? If you actually put a turbine

493
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:13,920
on a river or you capture a change in elevation of water, you've literally harnessed gravitational

494
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:22,240
energy. But water is also bringing you food. It's also giving you a cheap form of getting

495
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:27,760
rid of your waste. It's also giving you free transportation. You want to move one ton blocks

496
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:34,640
around. You want to move them in water. So I think, I mean, the human story is really the story

497
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:45,520
of engineering a better world. And the rise in the human condition is determined by those groups

498
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:52,400
of people, those civilizations that were best at harnessing energy, right? If you look, you know,

499
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:58,960
the Greek civilization, they built it around ports and seaports and water and created a trading

500
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:06,240
network. The Romans were really good at harnessing all sorts of engineering. I mean, the aqueducts are

501
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:11,760
a great example. If you go to any big city, you travel through cities and you see all these

502
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:17,440
people. If you go to any big city, you travel through cities in the Med, you find that, you

503
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:22,640
know, the carrying capacity of the city or the island is 5,000 people without running water.

504
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:26,720
And then if you can find a way to bring water to it, it increases by a factor of 10.

505
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:33,760
And so human flourishing is really only possible through that channeling of energy,

506
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:43,440
right? That eventually takes the form of air power, right? I mean, that ship, I mean, look

507
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:48,880
at the intricacy of those sails, right? I mean, it's just the model is intricate. Now, think about

508
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:53,520
all of the experimentation that took place to figure out how many sails to put on that ship and

509
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:58,080
how to rig them and how to repair them and how to operate them.

510
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:06,640
And it's thousands of lives spent thinking through all the tiny little details, all to increase the

511
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:12,640
efficiency of this, the effectiveness, the efficiency of this ship as it sails through

512
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:17,120
water. And we should also note there's a bunch of cannons on the side. So, obviously.

513
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:22,480
Another form of engineering, right? Energy harnessing with explosives.

514
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:25,280
To achieve what end? That's another discussion, exactly.

515
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:30,160
Suppose we're trying to get off the planet, right? I mean...

516
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:33,680
Well, there's a selection mechanism going on. So, natural selection,

517
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:39,280
this, whatever, however evolution works, it seems that one of the interesting inventions on earth

518
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:43,760
was the predator-prey dynamic, that you want to be the bigger fish.

519
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:51,440
That violence seems to serve a useful purpose if you look at earth as a whole. We, as humans,

520
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:56,320
now like to think of violence as really a bad thing. It seems to be one of the

521
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:01,360
amazing things about humans is we're ultimately tend towards cooperation.

522
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:09,280
We want to, we like peace. If you just look at history, we want things to be nice and calm and

523
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:16,320
but just wars break out every once in a while and lead to immense suffering and destruction

524
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:25,360
and so on. And they have a kind of, like, resetting the palette effect.

525
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:32,400
It's one that's full of just immeasurable human suffering, but it's like a way to start over.

526
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:39,040
We're quite the apex predator on the planet. And I googled something the other day,

527
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:45,920
you know, what's the most common form of mammal life on the earth?

528
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:48,000
By number of organisms?

529
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:48,400
Count.

530
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:49,120
By count.

531
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:53,520
And the answer that came back was human beings. I was shocked. I couldn't believe it, right? It

532
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:58,080
says, like, apparently, if we're just looking at mammals, the answer was human beings are the most

533
00:59:58,080 --> 01:00:03,920
common, which was very interesting to me. I almost didn't believe it, but I was trying to, you know,

534
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:09,360
8 billion or so human beings. There's no other mammal that's got more than 8 billion.

535
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:14,560
If you walk through downtown Edinburgh and Scotland and you look up on this hill and this

536
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:21,680
castle up on the hill, you know, and you talk to people and the story is, oh, yeah, well, that was

537
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:27,440
a British castle before it was a Scottish castle, before it was a Pict castle, before it was a Roman

538
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:35,600
castle, before it was, you know, some other Celtic castle. Then they found 13 prehistoric castles

539
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:42,400
buried one under the other under the other. And you get the conclusion that 100,000 years ago,

540
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:49,600
somebody showed up and grabbed the high point, the apex of the city, and they built a stronghold

541
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:53,680
there and they flourished and their family flourished and their tribe flourished until

542
01:00:53,680 --> 01:01:00,160
someone came along and knocked them off the hill. And it's been a nonstop, never-ending fight

543
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:08,560
by the aggressive, most powerful entity, family, organization, municipality, tribe, whatever.

544
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:09,680
All for the hill.

545
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:19,760
For that one hill going back since time immemorial. And, you know, you scratch your head and you

546
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:24,160
think it seems like it's like just this never-ending wheel.

547
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:30,240
But doesn't that lead, if you just, all kinds of metrics, that seems to improve the quality

548
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:36,800
of our cannons and ships as a result. Like, it seems that war, just like your laser eyes,

549
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:39,520
focuses the mind on the engineering tasks.

550
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:47,520
It is that. And it does remind you that the winner is always the most powerful.

551
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:53,280
And we throw that phrase out, but no one thinks about what that phrase means. Like,

552
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:58,080
who's the most powerful or the, you know, or the most powerful side one, but they don't think

553
01:01:58,080 --> 01:02:05,280
about it. And they think about power, energy delivered in a period of time. And then you think

554
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:11,280
a guy with a spear is more powerful than someone with their fist and someone with a bow and arrow

555
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:16,560
is more powerful than the person with the spear. And then you realize that somebody with bronze

556
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:21,280
is more powerful than without, and steel is more powerful than bronze. And if you look

557
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:26,080
at the Romans, you know, they persevered, you know, with artillery and they could stand

558
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:32,880
off from 800 meters and blast you to smithereens, right? You know, you study the history of the

559
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:38,080
Balearic slingers, right? And, you know, you think we invented bullets, but they invented

560
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:44,560
bullets to put in slings thousands of years ago. They could have stood off 500 meters and put a

561
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:55,600
hole in your head, right? And so there was never a time when humanity wasn't vying to come up with

562
01:02:55,600 --> 01:03:01,360
an asymmetric form of projecting their own power via technology.

563
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:09,920
And absolute power is when a leader is able to control a large amount of humans, they're

564
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:15,600
facing the same direction, working in the same direction to leverage energy.

565
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:17,920
The most organized society wins.

566
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:18,880
Yeah.

567
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:25,200
When the Romans were dominating everybody, they were the most organized civilization

568
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:31,600
in Europe. And as long as they stayed organized, they dominated. And at some point they over

569
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:38,160
expanded and got disorganized and they collapsed. And I guess you could say that, you know,

570
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:44,320
the struggle of the human condition, it catalyzes the development of new technologies one after the

571
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:52,560
other. It penalizes anybody that rejects ocean power, right? Gets penalized, you reject artillery,

572
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:57,920
you get penalized, you reject atomic power, you get penalized. If you reject digital power,

573
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:06,720
cyber power, you get penalized. And the underlying control of the property keeps shifting,

574
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:13,680
property keeps shifting hands from, you know, one institution or one government to another

575
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:19,440
based upon how rationally they're able to channel that energy and how well organized

576
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:20,480
or coordinated they are.

577
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:24,400
Well, that's a really interesting thing about both the human mind and governments

578
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:29,040
that they, once they get a few good, and companies, once they get a few good ideas,

579
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:35,600
they seem to stick with them. They reject new ideas. It's almost whether that's emergent or

580
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:41,680
however that evolved, it seems to have a really interesting effect because when you're young,

581
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:50,160
you fight for the new ideas. You push them through, then a few of us humans find success,

582
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:57,600
then we get complacent, we take over the world using that new idea, and then the new young

583
01:04:57,600 --> 01:05:04,800
person with the better new idea challenges you and you, as opposed to pivoting, you stick

584
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:10,240
with the old and lose because of it. And that's how empires collapse. And it's just both at

585
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:14,160
the individual level that happens when two academics fighting about ideas or something

586
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:21,360
like that. And at the human civilization level, governments, they hold on to the ideas of old.

587
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:23,040
It's fascinating.

588
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:29,680
An ever persistent theme in the history of science is the paradigm shift. And the paradigms

589
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:36,080
shift when the old guard dies and a new generation arrives, or the paradigm shifts when there's a

590
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:43,760
war, and everyone that disagrees with the idea of aviation finds bombs dropping on their head,

591
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:48,880
or everyone that disagrees with whatever your technology is, has a rude awakening. And

592
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:55,200
if they totally disagree, their society collapses and they're replaced by that new thing.

593
01:05:55,200 --> 01:06:01,680
A lot of the engineering you talked about had to do with ships and cannons and leveraging

594
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:08,800
water. What about this whole digital thing that's happening, been happening over the past century?

595
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:15,760
Is that still engineering in your mind? You're starting to operate in these bits of information.

596
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:23,440
I think there's two big ideas. The first wave of ideas were digital information.

597
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:29,760
And that was the internet wave been running since 1990 or so, for 30 years. And the second

598
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:38,320
wave is digital energy. So if I look at digital information, this idea that we want to digitally

599
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:46,880
transform a book, I'm going to dematerialize every book in this room into bits, and then I'm going to

600
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:54,480
deliver a copy of the entire library to a billion people, and I'm going to do it for pretty much

601
01:06:54,480 --> 01:07:03,840
de minimis electricity. If I can dematerialize music, books, education, entertainment, maps,

602
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:14,640
right? That is an incredibly exothermic transaction. It's a crystallization when we

603
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:18,480
collapse into a lower energy state as a civilization, and we give off massive

604
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:24,240
amounts of energy. If you look at what Carnegie did, the richest man in the world created libraries

605
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:29,040
everywhere at the time, and he gave away his entire fortune. And now we can give a better

606
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:35,840
library to every six-year-old for nothing. And so what's the value of giving a million books to

607
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:42,320
eight billion people? That's the explosion in prosperity that comes from digital transformation.

608
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:49,840
And when we do it with maps, I transform the map, I put it into a car, you get in the car,

609
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:55,680
and the car drives you where you want to go with the map. And how much better is that than

610
01:07:55,680 --> 01:08:02,400
a Rand McNally atlas right here? It's like a million times better. So the first wave

611
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:10,320
of digital transformation was the dematerialization of all of these informational things which are

612
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:16,640
non-conservative. I could take Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, played for by the best orchestra in

613
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:23,440
Germany, and I could give it to a billion people and they could play it a thousand times each at

614
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:29,360
less than the cost of the one performance, right? So I deliver culture and education and education

615
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:36,000
and intelligence and insight to the entire civilization over digital rails. And the

616
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:41,520
consequences of the human race are first order, generally good, right? The world is a better

617
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:47,040
place, it drives growth, and you create these trillion dollar entities like Apple and Amazon

618
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:54,080
and Facebook and Google and Microsoft, right? That is the first wave. The second wave...

619
01:08:54,080 --> 01:09:02,960
I do mind, I'm sorry to interrupt, but that first wave, it feels like the impact that's positive,

620
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:08,240
you said the first order impact is generally positive, it feels like it's positive in a way

621
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:16,320
that nothing else in history has been positive. And then we may not actually truly be able to

622
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:25,040
understand the orders of magnitude of increase in productivity, in just progress of human

623
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:31,520
civilization, until we look back centuries from now. It just feels, or maybe I'm, like just

624
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:40,640
looking at the impact of Wikipedia, the giving access to basic wisdom or basic knowledge and

625
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:46,960
then perhaps wisdom to billions of people. If you can just linger on that for a second. What's

626
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:48,960
your sense of the impact of that?

627
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:57,360
You know, I would say if you're a technologist philosopher,

628
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:06,000
the impact of a technology is so much greater on the civilization and the human condition

629
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:12,000
than a non-technology that is almost not worth your trouble to bother trying to fix things

630
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:19,440
a conventional way. So let's take an example. I have a foundation, the Saylor Academy, and the

631
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:26,240
Saylor Academy gives away free education, free college education to anybody on Earth that wants

632
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:32,320
it. And we've had more than a million students. And if you go and you take the physics class,

633
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:37,840
the lecturers were by the same physics lecturer that taught me physics at MIT. Except when I was

634
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:45,360
at MIT, the cost of the first four weeks of MIT would have drained my family's life, collective

635
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:50,960
life savings for the first last hundred years. Like a hundred years worth of my father, my

636
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:55,040
grandfather, my great-grandfather, they saved every penny they had after a hundred years. They

637
01:10:55,040 --> 01:11:01,120
could have paid for one week or two weeks of MIT, but they didn't. They didn't. They didn't.

638
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:08,080
Two weeks of MIT, that's how fiendishly expensive and inefficient it was. So I went on scholarship.

639
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:15,360
I was lucky to have a scholarship. But on the other hand, I sat in the back of the

640
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:21,520
801 lecture hall, and I was like right up in the rafters. It's an awful experience on these

641
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:26,880
uncomfortable wooden benches, and you can barely see the blackboard. And you got to be there

642
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:32,960
synchronously. And the stuff we upload, you can start it and stop it and watch it on your iPad

643
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:37,760
or watch it on your computer and rewind it multiple times and sit in a comfortable chair,

644
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:43,120
and you can do it from anywhere on earth, and it's absolutely free. So I think about this,

645
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:50,240
and I think you want to improve the human condition. You need people with postgraduate

646
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:55,520
level education. You need PhDs. And I know this sounds kind of elitist, but you want to cure

647
01:11:55,520 --> 01:12:05,120
cancer, and you want to go to the stars, fusion drive. We need new propulsion. We need extraordinary

648
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:14,720
breakthroughs in every area of basic science, be it biology or propulsion or material science or

649
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:19,360
computer science. You're not doing that with an undergraduate degree. You're certainly not doing

650
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:26,080
it with a high school education, but the cost of a PhD is like a million bucks. There's like 10

651
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:31,760
million PhDs in the world if you check it out. There's 8 billion people in the world. How many

652
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:38,800
people could get a PhD or would want to? Maybe not 8 billion, but a billion? 500 million? Let's just

653
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:46,560
say 500 million to a billion. How do you go from 10 million to a billion highly educated people,

654
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:52,880
all of them specializing in, and I don't have to tell you how many different fields of human

655
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:58,160
endeavor there are. I mean, your life is interviewing these experts, and there's so many,

656
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:06,960
right? It's amazing. So how do I give a multi-million dollar education to a billion

657
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:14,320
people? And there's two choices. You can either endow a scholarship, in which case you pay $75,000

658
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:21,760
a year. Okay, $75,000. Let's pay a million dollars a person. I can do it that way.

659
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:30,160
Even if you had a trillion dollars, if you had $10 trillion to throw at the problem,

660
01:13:30,160 --> 01:13:36,640
and we've just thrown $10 trillion at certain problems, you don't solve the problem, right?

661
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:40,880
If I put $10 trillion on the table and I said educate everybody, give them all a PhD,

662
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:46,320
you still wouldn't solve the problem. Harvard University can't educate 18,000 people

663
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:53,440
simultaneously, or 87,000, or 800,000, or 8 million. So you have to dematerialize the

664
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:58,880
professor and dematerialize the experience. So you put it all as streaming, on-demand,

665
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:05,600
computer-generated education, and you create simulations where you need to create simulations,

666
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:15,360
and you upload it. It's like the human condition is being held back by 500,000 well-meaning

667
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:23,440
average algebra teachers. I love them. I mean, please don't take offense if you're an algebra

668
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:30,400
teacher, but instead of 500,000 algebra teachers going through the same motion over and over again,

669
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:37,440
what you need is like one, or five, or 10 really good algebra teachers, and they need to do it a

670
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:45,920
billion times a day, or a billion times a year for free. And if we do that, there's no reason

671
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:53,120
why you can't give infinite education, certainly in science, technology, engineering, and math,

672
01:14:53,120 --> 01:15:00,800
right? Infinite education to everybody with no constraint. And I think the same is true,

673
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:07,040
right? With just about every other thing. If you want to bring joy to the world, you need digital

674
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:14,880
music. If you want to bring enlightenment to the world, you need digital education. If you want to

675
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:20,160
bring anything of consequence in the world, you got to digitally transform it, and then you got

676
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:27,040
to manufacture it something like a hundred times more efficiently as a start, but a million times

677
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:36,480
more efficiently is probably, you know, that's hopeful. Maybe you have a chance. And if you look

678
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:41,280
at all of these space endeavors and everything we're thinking about getting to Mars, getting off

679
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:45,920
the planet, getting to other worlds, number one thing you got to do is you got to make a

680
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:51,600
fundamental breakthrough in an engine. People dreamed about flying for thousands of years,

681
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:58,720
but until the internal combustion engine, you didn't have enough, you know, enough energy,

682
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:06,640
enough power in a light enough package in order to solve the problem. And the human race has all

683
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:16,720
sorts of those fundamental engines and materials and techniques that we need to master. And each

684
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:24,480
one of them is a lifetime of experimentation of someone capable of making a seminal contribution

685
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:29,440
to the body of human knowledge. There's certain problems like education that could be solved

686
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:37,120
through this process of dematerialization. And by the way, to give props to the 500k algebra teachers,

687
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:44,480
when I look at YouTube, for example, one possible approach is each one of those 500,000 teachers

688
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:49,360
probably had days and moments of brilliance. And if they had the ability to contribute to

689
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:56,560
in the natural selection process, like the market of education where the best ones rise up,

690
01:16:56,560 --> 01:17:04,640
that's a really interesting way, which is like the best day of your life, the best lesson you've ever

691
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:16,960
taught could be found and sort of broadcast to billions of people. So all of those kinds of ideas

692
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:23,120
can be made real in the digital world. Now traveling across planets, you still can't solve

693
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:30,320
that problem with dematerialization. What you could solve potentially is dematerializing the

694
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:36,640
human brain where you can transfer, like you don't need to have astronauts on the ship.

695
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:40,400
You can have a floppy disk carrying a human brain.

696
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:46,320
Touching on those points, you'd love for the 500,000 algebra teachers to become 500,000

697
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:52,800
math specialists, and maybe they clump into 50,000 specialties as teams and they all pursue

698
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:59,360
50,000 new problems and they put their algebra teaching on autopilot. That's the same as when

699
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:08,480
I give you 11 cents worth of electricity and you don't have to row a boat eight hours a day before

700
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:15,120
you can eat. It would be a lot better that you would pay for your food in the first eight seconds

701
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:20,640
of your day and then you could start thinking about other things, right? With regard to

702
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:27,920
technology, one thing that I learned studying technology when you look at S curves is

703
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:35,920
until you start the S curve, you don't know whether you're a hundred years from viability,

704
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:41,120
a thousand years from viability, or a few months from viability.

705
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:49,760
Isn't that fun? That's so fun. The early part of the S curve is so fun because you don't know.

706
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:56,720
In 1900, you could have got any number of learned academics to give you 10,000 reasons why

707
01:18:56,720 --> 01:19:02,400
humans will never fly, right? And in 1903, the Wright brothers flew and by 1969,

708
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:09,680
we're walking on the moon. So the advance that we made in that field was extraordinary,

709
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:14,400
but for the hundred years and 200 years before, they were just back and forth and nobody was

710
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:23,440
close. And that's the happy part. The happy part is we went from flying 20 miles an hour or whatever

711
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:33,360
to flying 25,000 miles an hour in 66 years. The unhappy part is I studied aeronautical

712
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:41,280
engineering at MIT in the 80s. And in the 80s, we had Gulfstream aircraft, we had Boeing 737s,

713
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:48,160
we had the Space Shuttle. And you fast forward 40 years and we pretty much had the same exact

714
01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:58,960
aircraft. The efficiency of the engines was 20, 30% more, right? We slammed into a brick wall

715
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:08,880
around 69 to 75. Like in fact, the Global Express, the Gulfstream, these were all engineered

716
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:17,920
in the 70s, some in the 60s. The fuselage silhouette of a Gulfstream of a G5 was the

717
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:23,440
same shape as a G4, is the same shape as a G3, is the same shape as a G2. And that's because they

718
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:27,760
were afraid to change the shape for 40 years because they worked it out in a wind tunnel,

719
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:32,880
they knew it worked. And when they finally decided to change the shape, it was like a

720
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:40,080
$10 billion exercise with modern supercomputers and computational fluid dynamics.

721
01:20:40,640 --> 01:20:46,400
Why was it so hard? What is that wall made of that you slammed into?

722
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:50,640
The right question is so why does a guy that went to MIT that got an aeronautical engineering degree

723
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:55,120
spend his career in software? Like why is it that I never a day in my life,

724
01:20:55,120 --> 01:21:00,080
you know, with the exception of some Air Force Reserve work, I never got paid to be

725
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:03,600
an aeronautical engineer and I worked in software engineering my entire career.

726
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:07,120
Maybe software engineering is the new aeronautical engineering in some way.

727
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:13,840
Maybe, like, maybe you hit fundamental walls uncertain until you have to return to it centuries

728
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:17,040
later. Or no?

729
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:21,200
The National Gallery of Art was endowed by a very rich man,

730
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:28,320
Andrew Mellon, and you know how he made his money? Aluminum. Okay? And so,

731
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:36,560
and you know what kind of airplanes you can create without aluminum? Nothing. Nothing, right?

732
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:38,480
So it's a materials problem.

733
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:46,000
Okay, so 1900, we made massive advances in metallurgy, right? I mean, that was US steel.

734
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:52,640
That was iron to steel, aluminum, massive fortunes were created because this was a massive technical

735
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:57,520
advance. And then we also had the internal combustion engine and, you know, the story of

736
01:21:57,520 --> 01:22:04,720
Ford and General Motors and Daimler Chrysler and the like is informed by that. So you have no jet

737
01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:10,400
engines, no rocket motors, no internal combustion engines, you have no aviation. But even if you had

738
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:15,920
those engines, if you were trying to build those things with steel, no chance. You had to have

739
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:23,200
aluminum. So there's like two pretty basic technologies. And once you have those two

740
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:32,640
technologies, stuff happens very fast. So tell me the last big advance in like jet engines,

741
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:39,280
there hasn't been one. Like there has the last big advance in rocket engines. Has it been one?

742
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:44,560
The big advances in spaceship design from what I can see are in the control systems,

743
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:51,120
the gyros and the ability to land, right, in a stable fashion. That's pretty amazing,

744
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:52,480
landing a rocket.

745
01:22:52,480 --> 01:23:02,320
Also in the, at least according to Elon and so on, the manufacture of the more efficient

746
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:07,840
and less expensive manufacture of rockets. So like it's a production, whatever that you call

747
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:13,760
that discipline of at scale manufacture, at scale production, so factory work. But it's not 10X.

748
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:17,840
I mean, maybe it's 10X over a period of a few decades.

749
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:24,960
When we figure out how to operate a spaceship, you know, on the water in your water bottle for

750
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:31,600
a year. Right? Now, then you've got a breakthrough. So the bottom line is propulsion, propellant,

751
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:38,800
propulsion technology, propellants and the materials technology, they were critical to

752
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:45,200
getting on that aviation S-curve. And then we slammed into a wall in the 70s. And the Boeing

753
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:53,040
747, the Global Express, the Gulfstream, these things were the space shuttle. They were all

754
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:57,280
pretty much reflective of that. And then we kind of, then we stopped. And at that point,

755
01:23:57,280 --> 01:24:04,000
you have to switch to a new S-curve. So the next equivalent to the internal combustion engine was

756
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:10,240
the CPU. And the next aluminum equivalent was silicon. So when we actually started developing

757
01:24:10,240 --> 01:24:18,160
CPUs, the transistor gave way to CPUs. And if you look at the power, right, the bandwidth that we

758
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:24,800
had on computers and Moore's law, right, what if the efficiency of jet engines had doubled

759
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:32,480
every three years, right, in the last 40 years, where we'd be right now, right. So I think that

760
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:40,480
if you're a business person, if you're looking for commercially viable application of your mind,

761
01:24:41,200 --> 01:24:48,480
then you have to find that S-curve. And ideally, you have to find it in the first five, six, ten

762
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:56,160
years. But people always miss this. Let's take Google Glass, right? Google Glass was an idea

763
01:24:56,160 --> 01:25:02,640
2013. The year is 2022. And people were quite sure this was going to be a big thing.

764
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:06,000
And it could have been at the beginning of the S-curve.

765
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:11,920
But fundamentally, we didn't really have an effective mechanism. I mean, people getting

766
01:25:11,920 --> 01:25:13,200
vertigo and they're, you know.

767
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:17,600
But you didn't know that at the beginning of the S-curve, right? I mean, maybe some people

768
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:23,280
had a deep intuition about the fundamentals of augmented reality. But you don't know that.

769
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:27,280
You don't have those. You're looking through the fog. You don't know.

770
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:34,880
So the point is, we're year zero in 2013, and we're still year zero in 2022 on that augmented

771
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:42,240
reality. And when somebody puts out a set of glasses that you can wear comfortably without

772
01:25:42,240 --> 01:25:49,360
getting vertigo, right, without any disorientation that managed to have the stability and the

773
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:56,000
bandwidth necessary to sync with the real world, you'll be in year one. And from that

774
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:02,720
point, you'll have a 70-year or some interesting future until you slam into a limit to growth.

775
01:26:02,720 --> 01:26:10,240
And then it'll slow down. And this is the story of a lot of things, right? I mean, John

776
01:26:10,240 --> 01:26:17,760
D. Rockefeller got in the oil business in the 1860s. And the oil business as we understood

777
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:25,280
it, you know, became fairly mature, you know, by the 1920s, the 30s. And then it actually

778
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:29,920
stayed that way until we got to fracking, which was like seven years later, and then

779
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:32,240
it burst forward. So...

780
01:26:32,240 --> 01:26:37,520
The interesting story about Moore's law, though, is that you get this, like, constant burst

781
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:42,720
of S curves on top of S curves on top of S curves. It's like the moment you start slowing

782
01:26:42,720 --> 01:26:48,720
down, or almost ahead of you slowing down, you come up with another innovation, another

783
01:26:48,720 --> 01:26:55,200
innovation. So Moore's law doesn't seem to happen in every technological advancement.

784
01:26:55,200 --> 01:27:00,720
It seems like you only get a couple of S curves and then you're done for a bit. So I wonder

785
01:27:00,720 --> 01:27:05,760
what the pressures there are that resulted in such success over several decades and still

786
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:07,680
going.

787
01:27:07,680 --> 01:27:16,000
Humility dictates that nobody knows when the S curve kicks off and you could be 20 years

788
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:22,400
early or 100 years early. Leonardo da Vinci, you know, they were Michelangelo, they were

789
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:27,920
designing flying machines hundreds and hundreds of years ago. So humility says you're not

790
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:32,800
quite sure when it's when you really hit that commercial viability. And it also dictates

791
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:38,960
you don't know when it ends. Like, when will the party stop? When will Moore's law stop

792
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:43,920
and we'll get to the point where they're exponentially diminishing returns on silicon

793
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:51,920
performance? And just like we got exponentially diminishing returns on jet engines, you know,

794
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:57,760
and it just takes an exponential increase in effort to make it 10% better. But while

795
01:27:57,760 --> 01:28:02,800
you're in the middle of it, then you know you can do things. So the reason that the

796
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:10,320
digital revolution is so important is because the underlying platforms, the bandwidth of

797
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:17,840
and the performance of the components, and I said the components are the radio protocols,

798
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:27,600
mobile protocols, the batteries, the CPUs, and the displays, right? Those four components

799
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:31,920
are pretty critical. They're all critical in the creation of an iPhone. I wrote about

800
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:39,360
it in the book The Mobile Wave, and they catalyzed this entire mobile revolution. Because they

801
01:28:39,360 --> 01:28:46,480
have advanced and continue to advance, they created the very fertile environment for all

802
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:55,280
these digital transformations. And the digital transformations themselves, right, they call

803
01:28:55,280 --> 01:29:01,920
for creativity in their own, right? Like, I think the interesting thing about, let's

804
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:08,560
take digital maps, right? When you conceptualize something as a dematerialized map, right,

805
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:14,960
it becomes a map because I can put it on a display like an iPad, or I can put it in a

806
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:21,360
car like a Tesla. But if you really want to figure it out, you can't think like an engineer,

807
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:26,320
you need to think like a fantasy writer. Like, this is where it's useful if you studied,

808
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:30,640
if you read, played Dungeons and Dragons, and you read Lord of the Rings, and you

809
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:36,880
studied all the fantasy literature. Because when I dematerialize the map,

810
01:29:38,080 --> 01:29:44,160
first I put 10 million pages of satellite imagery into the map, right? That's a simple

811
01:29:44,160 --> 01:29:51,680
physical transform. But then I start to put telemetry into the map, and I keep track of

812
01:29:51,680 --> 01:29:55,680
the traffic rates on the roads, and I tell you whether you'll be in a traffic jam if

813
01:29:55,680 --> 01:29:59,760
you drive that way, and I tell you which way to drive. And then I start to get feedback

814
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:02,800
on where you're going, and I tell you the restaurant's closed, and people don't like

815
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:08,400
it anyway. And then I put an AI on top of it, and I have it drive your car for you.

816
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:14,800
And eventually, the implication of digital transformation of maps is, I get in a self

817
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:21,440
driving car, and I say, take me someplace cool where I can eat. Right? And how did you

818
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:28,800
get to that last step, right? It wasn't simple engineering. There's a bit of fantasy in there,

819
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:34,320
a bit of magic. Design, art, whatever the heck you call it. It's whatever, yeah, fantasy

820
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:44,960
injects magic into the engineering process. Imagination precedes great revolutions in

821
01:30:44,960 --> 01:30:51,040
engineering. It's like imagining a world of what you can do with the display. How will

822
01:30:51,040 --> 01:30:54,640
the interaction be? That's where Google Glass actually came in. Augmented reality, virtual

823
01:30:54,640 --> 01:30:59,280
reality, people were playing in the space of sci-fi. Imagination.

824
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:03,280
They called a moan shot. They tried. It didn't work. But to their credit, they stopped trying,

825
01:31:03,280 --> 01:31:10,000
right? And then there's new people. They keep dreaming. Dreamers all around us. I love those

826
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:16,000
dreamers. And most of them fail and suffer because of it. But some of them win Nobel

827
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:23,680
Prizes or become billionaires. Well, what I would say is, if half the civilization dropped

828
01:31:23,680 --> 01:31:31,840
what they were doing tomorrow, and eagerly started working on launching a rocket to Alpha

829
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:40,160
Centauri, it might not be the best use of our resources. Because it's kind of like if half

830
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:46,800
of Athens in the year 500 BC eagerly started working on flying machines, if you went back

831
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:51,680
and you said, what advice would you give them? You would say, it's not going to work until

832
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:54,640
you get to aluminum. And you're not going to get to aluminum until you work out the

833
01:31:54,640 --> 01:31:58,960
steel and certain other things. And you're not going to get to that until you work out

834
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:03,760
the calculus of variations and some metallurgy. And there's a dude, Newton, that won't come

835
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:07,920
along for quite a while. And he's going to give you the calculus to do it. And until

836
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:13,920
then, it's hopeless. So you might be better off to work on the aqueduct or to focus upon

837
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:22,080
sales or something. So if I look at this today, I say there's massive, profound

838
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:28,400
civilization advances to be made through digital transformation of information. And you can see

839
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:34,720
them. This is the story of today. This is not the story of today, right? It's 10 years old,

840
01:32:34,720 --> 01:32:39,040
what we've been seeing. We're living through different manifestations of that story today,

841
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:45,680
too, though. Like social media, the effects of that is very interesting. Because ideas

842
01:32:45,680 --> 01:32:52,480
spread even, you talk about velocity of money, the velocity of ideas keeps increasing. So like

843
01:32:52,480 --> 01:33:02,400
Wikipedia is a passive store. It's a store of knowledge. Twitter is like a water hose or

844
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:06,400
something. It's like spraying you with knowledge, whether you want it or not. It's like social

845
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:13,120
media is just like this explosion of ideas. And then we pick them up. And then we try to

846
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:18,640
understand ourselves because the drama of it also plays with our human psyche. So sometimes

847
01:33:18,640 --> 01:33:24,000
there's more ability for misinformation, for propaganda to take hold. So we get to learn

848
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:28,560
about ourselves. We get to learn about the technology that can decelerate the propaganda,

849
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:32,880
for example, all that kind of stuff. But like the reality is we're living, I feel like we're

850
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:39,360
living through a singularity in the digital information space. And we're not, we don't have

851
01:33:39,360 --> 01:33:44,800
a great understanding of exactly how it's transforming our lives. This is where money is

852
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:53,200
useful as a metaphor for significance. Because if money is the economic energy of the

853
01:33:53,200 --> 01:34:01,360
civilization, then something that's extraordinarily lucrative that's going to generate a monetary or

854
01:34:01,360 --> 01:34:06,160
wealth increase is a way to increase the net energy in the civilization. And ultimately,

855
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:13,680
if we had 10 times as much of everything, we'd have a lot more free resources to pursue all of

856
01:34:13,680 --> 01:34:18,240
our advanced scientific and mathematical and theoretical endeavors. So let's take Twitter.

857
01:34:19,200 --> 01:34:25,760
Twitter is something that could be 10 times more valuable than it is. Twitter could be made 10 times

858
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:29,440
better. No, by the way, I should say that people should follow you on Twitter. Your

859
01:34:29,440 --> 01:34:34,160
Twitter account is awesome. Thank you. It could be made 10 times better. Yeah. Yeah,

860
01:34:34,160 --> 01:34:40,720
Twitter can be made 10 times better. If we take YouTube or take education,

861
01:34:40,720 --> 01:34:46,720
we could generate a billion PhDs. And the question is, do you need any profound

862
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:51,120
breakthrough in materials or technology to do that? And the answer is not really.

863
01:34:52,080 --> 01:34:57,840
Right. So if you want to, you could make Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google, Twitter,

864
01:34:57,840 --> 01:35:05,520
all these things better. The United States government, if they took 1% of the money they

865
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:11,840
spend on the Department of Education, and they simply poured it into digital education, and they

866
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:19,600
gave degrees to people that actually met those requirements, they could provide 100x as much

867
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:25,520
education for one one-hundredth of the cost, and they could do it with no new technology. That's a

868
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:34,800
marketing and political challenge. So I don't think every objective is equally practical. And I think

869
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:44,000
the benefit of being an engineer or thinking about practical achievements is when the government

870
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:51,840
pursues an impractical objective, or when anybody, an entrepreneur, not so bad with entrepreneur,

871
01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:56,320
because they don't have that much money to waste. When a government pursues an impractical objective,

872
01:35:56,320 --> 01:36:02,240
they squander trillions and trillions of dollars and achieve nothing. Whereas if they pursue a

873
01:36:02,240 --> 01:36:10,000
practical objective, or if they simply get out of the way and do nothing, and they allow the free

874
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:15,920
market to pursue the practical objectives, then I think you can have profound impact on the human

875
01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:28,960
civilization. And if I look at the world we're in today, I think that there are multi-trillion,

876
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:36,560
10, 20, 50 trillion dollars worth of opportunities in the digital information realm yet to be

877
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:46,080
obtained. But there's hundreds of trillions of dollars of opportunities in the digital energy

878
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:53,040
realm that not only are they not obtained, the majority of people don't even know what digital

879
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:59,600
energy is. Most of them would reject the concept. They're not looking for it. They're not expecting

880
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:07,680
to find it. It's inconceivable because it is a paradigm shift. But in fact, it's completely

881
01:37:07,680 --> 01:37:15,280
practical. Right under our nose, it's staring at us, and it could make the entire civilization

882
01:37:15,280 --> 01:37:22,720
work dramatically better in every respect. So you mentioned in the digital world, digital

883
01:37:22,720 --> 01:37:31,600
information is one, digital energy is two, and the possible impact on the world and the set of

884
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:38,400
opportunities available in the digital energy space is much greater. So how do you think about

885
01:37:38,400 --> 01:37:45,600
digital energy? What is it? So I'll start with Tesla. He had a very famous quote. He said,

886
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:53,360
if you want to understand the universe, think in terms of energy, vibration, and frequency. And

887
01:37:53,360 --> 01:37:57,680
it gets you thinking about what is the universe. And of course, the universe is just all energy.

888
01:37:58,720 --> 01:38:05,920
And then what is matter? Matter is low-frequency energy. And what are we? You know, we're

889
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:13,760
vibrating from, you know, ashes to ashes, dust to dust. I can turn a tree into light. I can turn

890
01:38:13,760 --> 01:38:21,200
light back into a tree. If I consider the entire universe, and it's very important because we don't

891
01:38:21,200 --> 01:38:28,800
really think this way. Let's take the New York disco model. If I walk into a nightclub, and

892
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:35,840
there's loud music blaring in New York City, what's really going on there? Right? If you

893
01:38:35,840 --> 01:38:42,240
blast out 14 billion years ago, the universe is formed. Okay, that's a low-frequency thing,

894
01:38:42,240 --> 01:38:47,360
the universe. Four and a half billion years ago, the sun, maybe the earth, are formed.

895
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:54,240
The continents are 400 million years old. The schist that New York City is on is some hundreds

896
01:38:54,240 --> 01:39:00,400
of millions of years. But the Hudson River is only 20,000 years. There's a building that's

897
01:39:00,400 --> 01:39:07,440
probably 50 years old. There's a company operating that disco or that club, which is five to 10 years

898
01:39:07,440 --> 01:39:13,040
old. There's a person, a customer walking in there for an experience for a few hours.

899
01:39:13,760 --> 01:39:19,760
There's music that's oscillating at some kilohertz, and then there's light.

900
01:39:20,720 --> 01:39:28,080
And you have all forms of energy, all frequencies, right? All layered, all moving through different

901
01:39:28,080 --> 01:39:34,960
medium. And how you perceive the world is the question of at what frequency do you want to

902
01:39:34,960 --> 01:39:45,600
perceive the world? And I think that once you start to think that way, you're catalyzed to

903
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:54,320
think about what would digital energy look like? And why would I want it? And what is it? So,

904
01:39:55,760 --> 01:40:01,440
why don't we just start right there? What is it? The most famous manifestation of digital energy

905
01:40:01,440 --> 01:40:08,080
is Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a crypto asset. It's a crypto asset that has monetary value.

906
01:40:08,080 --> 01:40:17,200
Can we just link on that? Bitcoin is a digital asset that has monetary value.

907
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:23,920
What is a digital asset? What is monetary? Why use those terms versus the words of

908
01:40:23,920 --> 01:40:29,760
money and currency? Is there something interesting in that disambiguation of different terms?

909
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:39,760
I'd call it a crypto asset network. The goal is to create a billion dollar block of pure energy

910
01:40:39,760 --> 01:40:47,840
in cyberspace, one that I could then move with no friction at the speed of light.

911
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:56,320
It's the equivalent to putting a million pounds in orbit. How do I actually launch

912
01:40:56,320 --> 01:41:02,160
something into orbit? How do I launch something into cyberspace such that it moves friction-free?

913
01:41:02,160 --> 01:41:11,680
And the solution is a decentralized proof-of-work network. Satoshi's solution was I'm going to

914
01:41:11,680 --> 01:41:18,400
establish a protocol running on a distributed set of computers that will maintain a constant supply

915
01:41:18,400 --> 01:41:24,560
of never more than 21 million Bitcoin subdividable by 100 million Satoshis each.

916
01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:39,360
Transferable via transferring private keys. Now, the innovation is to create that in an ethical,

917
01:41:40,320 --> 01:41:47,360
durable fashion. The ethical innovation is I want it to be property and not a security.

918
01:41:47,360 --> 01:41:55,280
A bushel of corn, an acre of land, a stack of lumber, and a bar of gold and a Bitcoin

919
01:41:55,280 --> 01:42:01,120
are all property. And that means they're all commonly occurring elements in the world. You

920
01:42:01,120 --> 01:42:05,360
could call them commodities, but commodity is a little bit misleading, and I'll tell you why in a

921
01:42:05,360 --> 01:42:11,520
second. But they're all distinguished by the fact that no one entity or person or government

922
01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:18,320
controls them. If you have a barrel of oil, and you're in Ukraine versus Russia versus Saudi

923
01:42:18,320 --> 01:42:26,560
Arabia versus the US, you have a barrel of oil, right? And it doesn't matter what the premier

924
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:34,000
in Japan or the mayor of Miami Beach thinks about your barrel of oil. They cannot wave their hand

925
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:41,520
and make it not a barrel of oil or a cord of wood, right? And so property is just a naturally

926
01:42:41,520 --> 01:42:48,320
occurring element in the universe, right? And- Why use the word ethical? And sorry to- I may

927
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:53,040
interrupt occasionally. Why ethical assigned to property?

928
01:42:54,640 --> 01:43:00,000
Because if it's a security, a security would be an example of a share of a stock,

929
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:08,320
or a crypto token controlled by a small team. And in the event that something is a security, because

930
01:43:09,280 --> 01:43:15,680
some small group or some identifiable group can control its nature, character, or supply,

931
01:43:17,440 --> 01:43:25,120
then it really only becomes ethical to promote it or sell it pursuant to fair disclosures.

932
01:43:25,120 --> 01:43:33,120
So I give you maybe practical example. I'm the mayor of Chicago. I give a speech. My speech,

933
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:38,720
I say, I think everybody in Chicago should own their own farm and have chicken, a chicken in

934
01:43:38,720 --> 01:43:46,880
the backyard and their own horse and an automobile. That's ethical. I give the same speech and I say,

935
01:43:46,880 --> 01:43:50,640
I think everybody in Chicago should buy Twitter. I think everybody in Chicago should buy Twitter.

936
01:43:50,640 --> 01:43:55,520
I give the same speech and I say, I think everybody in Chicago should buy Twitter stock,

937
01:43:57,520 --> 01:44:00,240
sell their house or sell their cash and buy Twitter stock.

938
01:44:01,760 --> 01:44:07,360
Is that ethical? Not really. But at that point, you've entered into a conflict of interest,

939
01:44:07,360 --> 01:44:14,240
because what you're doing is you're promoting an asset, which is substantially controlled by

940
01:44:14,240 --> 01:44:19,760
a small group of people, the board of directors or the CEO of the company. So if, you know,

941
01:44:19,760 --> 01:44:24,480
how would you feel if the president of the United States said, I really think Americans should all

942
01:44:25,120 --> 01:44:31,040
buy Apple stock, especially if you worked at Google. But you worked anywhere. You'd be like,

943
01:44:31,040 --> 01:44:40,480
why isn't he saying buy mine? Right? A security is a proprietary asset in some way, shape, or form.

944
01:44:41,360 --> 01:44:44,800
And the whole nature of securities law, it starts from this ancient,

945
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:54,720
ancient idea, thou shalt not lie, cheat, or steal. Okay? So if I'm going to sell you securities,

946
01:44:54,720 --> 01:45:00,720
or I'm going to promote securities as a public figure or as an influencer or anybody else,

947
01:45:02,320 --> 01:45:07,600
if I create my own yo-yo coin or Mikey coin, and then there's a million of them,

948
01:45:08,160 --> 01:45:12,800
and I tell you that I think that it's a really good thing and Mikey coin will go up forever,

949
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:18,640
right? And everybody buys Mikey coin, and then I give 10 million to you and don't tell the public,

950
01:45:18,640 --> 01:45:25,040
right? I've cheated them. Maybe if I have Mikey coin, and I think there's only 2 million Mikey

951
01:45:25,040 --> 01:45:30,240
coin, and I swear to you, there's only 2 million, and then I get married, and I have three kids,

952
01:45:30,240 --> 01:45:36,080
and my third kid is in the hospital, and my kid's going to die, and I have this ethical reason to

953
01:45:36,080 --> 01:45:40,480
print 500,000 more Mikey coin, or else people are going to die, and everybody tells me it's fine.

954
01:45:40,480 --> 01:45:47,040
You know, I've still abused, you know, the investor, right? It's an ethical challenge.

955
01:45:47,920 --> 01:45:56,880
If you look at ethics laws everywhere in the world, they all boil down to having a clause

956
01:45:56,880 --> 01:46:02,960
which says that if you're a public figure, you can't endorse any security. You can't endorse

957
01:46:02,960 --> 01:46:08,000
something that would cause you to have a conflict of interest. So if you're a mayor, a governor,

958
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:15,120
a country, a public figure, an influencer, and you want to promote or promulgate or support

959
01:46:15,120 --> 01:46:22,880
something using any public influence or funds or resources you may have, it needs to be property.

960
01:46:22,880 --> 01:46:29,760
It can't be security. So it goes beyond that, right? I mean, like would the Chinese want to

961
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:35,600
support an American company, right? As soon as you look at what's in the best interest of the

962
01:46:35,600 --> 01:46:44,560
human race, the civilization, you realize that if you want an ethical path forward, it needs to be

963
01:46:44,560 --> 01:46:52,720
based on common property, which is fair. And the way you get to a common property is through an

964
01:46:52,720 --> 01:46:59,040
open permissionless protocol. If it's not open, right, if it's proprietary, and I know what the

965
01:46:59,040 --> 01:47:04,320
code says, and you don't know what the code says, that makes it a security. If it's not open,

966
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:14,000
it's a security. If it's permissioned, if you're not allowed on my network, or if you can be

967
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:24,720
censored or booted off my network, that also makes it a security. So when I talk about property,

968
01:47:24,720 --> 01:47:30,640
I mean, the challenge here is how do I create something that's equivalent to a barrel of oil

969
01:47:30,640 --> 01:47:37,840
in cyberspace? And that means it has to be a non-sovereign bearer instrument, open,

970
01:47:37,840 --> 01:47:47,760
permissionless, not censorable, right? If I could do that, then I could deliver you 10,000

971
01:47:47,760 --> 01:47:55,440
dematerialized barrels of oil, and you would take settlement of them. And you would know that you

972
01:47:55,440 --> 01:48:02,320
have possession of that property, irregardless of the opinion of any politician or any company

973
01:48:02,320 --> 01:48:09,920
or anybody else in the world. That's a really critical characteristic. And it actually is,

974
01:48:11,040 --> 01:48:16,720
it's probably one of the fundamental things that makes Bitcoin special. Bitcoin isn't just

975
01:48:16,720 --> 01:48:22,560
a crypto asset network. It's easy to create a crypto asset network. It's very hard to create

976
01:48:22,560 --> 01:48:31,840
an ethical crypto asset network because you have to create one without any government or

977
01:48:32,720 --> 01:48:37,280
corporation or investor exercising in-do influence to make it successful.

978
01:48:37,280 --> 01:48:41,280
LR So open, permissionless, non-censorable.

979
01:48:42,480 --> 01:48:50,560
So basically no way for you without explicitly saying so outsourcing control to somebody else.

980
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:57,760
So it's a kind of, you have full control. Even with the barrel of oil, what's the

981
01:48:57,760 --> 01:49:05,440
difference between a barrel of oil and a Bitcoin to you? What is the, because you kind of mentioned

982
01:49:05,440 --> 01:49:11,920
that both are property. You mentioned Russia and China and so on. Is it the ability of the

983
01:49:11,920 --> 01:49:17,440
government to confiscate? In the end, governments can probably confiscate no matter what the asset

984
01:49:17,440 --> 01:49:21,280
is, but you want to lessen the effort involved.

985
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:23,520
LR A barrel of oil is a bucket of physical

986
01:49:23,520 --> 01:49:27,680
property, liquid property, and Bitcoin is a digital property.

987
01:49:27,680 --> 01:49:31,360
LR But it's easier to confiscate a barrel of oil.

988
01:49:31,360 --> 01:49:38,160
LR It's easier to confiscate things in the real world than things in cyberspace. Much easier.

989
01:49:38,160 --> 01:49:40,640
LR So that's not universally true. Some things

990
01:49:40,640 --> 01:49:48,000
in the digital space are actually easier to confiscate because just the nature of how things

991
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
move easily with information, right?

992
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,160
LR I think in the Bitcoin world, what we would

993
01:49:52,160 --> 01:50:01,040
say is that Bitcoin is the most difficult property that the human race possesses or has yet invented

994
01:50:01,040 --> 01:50:05,920
to confiscate. And that's by virtue of the fact that you could take possession of it via your

995
01:50:05,920 --> 01:50:12,320
private key. So if you got your 12 seed phrases in your head, then that will be the highest

996
01:50:12,320 --> 01:50:17,120
form of property right because I literally have to crack your head open and read your

997
01:50:17,120 --> 01:50:23,920
mind to take it. It doesn't mean I couldn't extract it from you under duress, but it means

998
01:50:23,920 --> 01:50:29,680
that it's harder than every other thing you might own. In fact, it's exponentially harder.

999
01:50:29,680 --> 01:50:36,400
If you consider every other thing you might own, a car, a house, a share of stock, gold,

1000
01:50:36,400 --> 01:50:42,880
diamonds, property rights, intellectual property rights, movie rights, music rights, anything

1001
01:50:42,880 --> 01:50:49,680
imaginable, they would all be easier by orders and orders of magnitude to seize. So digital

1002
01:50:49,680 --> 01:50:57,120
property in the form of a set of private keys is by far the apex property of the human race.

1003
01:50:57,120 --> 01:51:01,840
In terms of ethics, I want to make one more point. It's like I might say to you, Lex,

1004
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:08,080
I think Bitcoin is the best, most secure, most durable crypto asset network in the world is

1005
01:51:08,080 --> 01:51:13,680
going to go up forever and there's nothing better in the world. I might be right. I might be wrong.

1006
01:51:15,360 --> 01:51:21,920
But the point is because it's property, it's ethical for me to say that if I were to turn

1007
01:51:21,920 --> 01:51:28,560
around and say, Lex, I think the same about microstrategy stock, MSTR, that's a security.

1008
01:51:29,840 --> 01:51:37,920
If I'm wrong about that, I have civil liability or other liability because I could go to a board

1009
01:51:37,920 --> 01:51:42,880
meeting tomorrow and I could actually propose we issue a million more shares of microstrategy stock.

1010
01:51:43,600 --> 01:51:50,800
Whereas the thing that makes Bitcoin ethical for me to even promote is the knowledge that I can't

1011
01:51:50,800 --> 01:51:58,800
change it. If I knew that I could make it 42 million instead of 21 million and I had the button

1012
01:51:58,800 --> 01:52:06,640
back here, then I have a different degree of ethical responsibility. Now, I could tell you

1013
01:52:06,640 --> 01:52:10,400
your life will be better if you buy Bitcoin and it might not. You might go buy Bitcoin,

1014
01:52:10,400 --> 01:52:14,880
you might lose the keys and be bankrupt and your life ends and your life is not better because you

1015
01:52:14,880 --> 01:52:21,600
bought Bitcoin, right? But it wouldn't be my ethical liability any more than if I were to say,

1016
01:52:22,880 --> 01:52:28,080
Lex, I think you ought to get a farm. I think you should be a farmer. I think a chicken in

1017
01:52:28,080 --> 01:52:36,320
every pot, you should get a horse. I think you'd be better. I mean, these are all opinions expressed

1018
01:52:36,320 --> 01:52:43,840
about property, which may or may not be right, that you may or may not agree with. But in a legal

1019
01:52:43,840 --> 01:52:49,600
sense, if we read the law, if we understand securities law, and I would say most people

1020
01:52:49,600 --> 01:52:55,120
in the crypto industry, they didn't take companies public and so they're not really

1021
01:52:55,120 --> 01:52:59,600
focused on the securities law, they don't even know the securities law. If you focus on the

1022
01:52:59,600 --> 01:53:05,760
securities law, that would say you just can't legally sell this stuff to the general public

1023
01:53:05,760 --> 01:53:13,920
or promote it without a full set of continuing disclosures signed off on by a regulator. So

1024
01:53:15,120 --> 01:53:22,640
there's a fairly bright line there with regard to securities, but when you get to the secondary

1025
01:53:22,640 --> 01:53:31,120
issue, it's how do you actually build a world based on digital property if public figures

1026
01:53:31,120 --> 01:53:39,280
can't embrace it or endorse it? You see, so you're not going to build a better world based upon

1027
01:53:40,240 --> 01:53:46,240
Twitter stock, if that's your idea of property, because Twitter stock is a security and Twitter

1028
01:53:46,240 --> 01:53:52,480
stock is never going to be a non-sovereign bearer instrument in Russia, right, or in China, right?

1029
01:53:52,480 --> 01:53:57,760
It's not even legal in China, right? So it's not a global permissionless open thing. It will never

1030
01:53:57,760 --> 01:54:04,560
be trusted by the rest of the world and legally, it's impractical, but would you really want to

1031
01:54:04,560 --> 01:54:08,960
put $100 trillion worth of economic value on Twitter stock if there's a board of directors

1032
01:54:08,960 --> 01:54:15,040
and a CEO that could just get up and like take half of it tomorrow? The answer is no. So if you

1033
01:54:15,040 --> 01:54:22,160
want to build a better world based on digital energy, you need to start with constructing a

1034
01:54:22,160 --> 01:54:32,720
digital property and I'm using property here in the legal sense, but I would also go to the next

1035
01:54:32,720 --> 01:54:43,440
step and say property is low frequency money. So if I give you a million dollars and you want to

1036
01:54:43,440 --> 01:54:50,240
hold it for a decade, you might go buy a house with it, right? And the house is low frequency

1037
01:54:50,240 --> 01:54:57,040
money. You converted the million dollars of economic energy into a structure called a house.

1038
01:54:57,040 --> 01:55:02,880
Maybe after a decade, you might convert it back into energy. You might sell the house for currency

1039
01:55:03,680 --> 01:55:07,200
and it'll be more worth more or less depending upon the monetary climate.

1040
01:55:07,200 --> 01:55:12,800
The frequency means what here? How quickly it changes state?

1041
01:55:12,800 --> 01:55:22,720
How quickly does something vibrate? So if I transfer $10 from me to you for a drink

1042
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:27,680
and then you turn around and you buy another, right? We're vibrating on a frequency of every

1043
01:55:27,680 --> 01:55:33,680
few hours, right? The energy is changing hands, but it's not likely that you sell and buy houses

1044
01:55:33,680 --> 01:55:41,200
every few hours, right? The frequency of a transaction in real estate is every 10 years,

1045
01:55:41,200 --> 01:55:45,360
every 10 years, every five years. It's a much lower frequency transaction.

1046
01:55:48,480 --> 01:55:55,760
So when you think about what's going on here, you have extremely low frequency things,

1047
01:55:56,560 --> 01:56:02,880
which we'll call property. Then you have mid frequency things. I'm going to call them money

1048
01:56:02,880 --> 01:56:10,080
or currency. And then you have high frequency and that's energy. And that's why I use the

1049
01:56:10,080 --> 01:56:15,760
illustration of you got the building, you got the light and you got the sound and they're all just

1050
01:56:16,320 --> 01:56:26,160
energy moving at different frequencies. Now, Bitcoin is magical and it is truly the innovation.

1051
01:56:26,160 --> 01:56:32,240
It's like a singularity because it represents the first time in the history of human race

1052
01:56:32,240 --> 01:56:39,760
that we managed to create a digital property properly understood. It's easy to create

1053
01:56:39,760 --> 01:56:48,880
something digital, right? Every coupon and every scan on Fortnite and Roblox and Apple TV credits

1054
01:56:48,880 --> 01:56:53,360
and all these things, they're all digital something, but they're securities, right?

1055
01:56:53,360 --> 01:56:59,280
Shares of stock are securities. Whenever anybody transfers, when you transfer money on PayPal or

1056
01:56:59,280 --> 01:57:06,960
Apple Pay, you're transferring an essence, a security or an IOU. And so transferring a bearer

1057
01:57:06,960 --> 01:57:15,280
instrument with final settlement in the internet domain or in cyberspace, that's a critical thing.

1058
01:57:15,920 --> 01:57:22,560
And anybody in the crypto world can do that. All the cryptos can do that. But what they can't do,

1059
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:27,760
what 99% of them fail to do is be property. They're securities.

1060
01:57:27,760 --> 01:57:31,040
Well, there's a line there I'd like to explore a little further. For example,

1061
01:57:31,040 --> 01:57:37,440
what about when you, like Coinbase or something like that, when there's an exchange that you buy

1062
01:57:37,440 --> 01:57:47,120
Bitcoin is in, you start to move away from this kind of, some of the aspects that you said makes

1063
01:57:47,120 --> 01:57:58,880
up a property, which is this non-sensible and permissionless and open. So in order to achieve

1064
01:57:58,880 --> 01:58:06,400
the convenience, the effectiveness of the transfer of energy, you have to leverage some of these

1065
01:58:07,840 --> 01:58:12,640
places that remove the aspects of property. So I mean, maybe you can comment on that.

1066
01:58:12,640 --> 01:58:17,360
Let me give you a good model for that. If you think about the layer one of Bitcoin,

1067
01:58:18,400 --> 01:58:25,440
the layer one is the property settlement layer, and we're going to do 350,000 transactions or

1068
01:58:25,440 --> 01:58:31,920
less a day, 100 million transactions a year is the bandwidth on the layer one. And it would be an

1069
01:58:31,920 --> 01:58:37,520
ideal layer one to move a billion dollars from point A to point B with the massive security.

1070
01:58:38,720 --> 01:58:45,280
The role of the layer one is two things. One thing is I want to move a large sum of money

1071
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:53,440
through space with security. I can move any amount of Bitcoin in a matter of minutes,

1072
01:58:53,440 --> 01:59:01,120
for dollars on layer one. The second important feature of the layer one is I need the money to

1073
01:59:01,120 --> 01:59:08,800
last forever. I need the money indestructible, immortal. So the bigger trick is not to move a

1074
01:59:08,800 --> 01:59:13,920
billion dollars from here to Tokyo. The big trick is to move a billion dollars from here to the year

1075
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:23,600
2140. And that's what we want to solve with layer one. And the best real metaphor in New York City

1076
01:59:23,600 --> 01:59:30,800
would be the granite or the schist. What you want is a city block of bedrock. And how long has it

1077
01:59:30,800 --> 01:59:35,760
been there? Like millions of years it's been there. And how fast do you want it to move?

1078
01:59:36,320 --> 01:59:40,720
You don't. In fact, the single thing that's most important is that it not

1079
01:59:40,720 --> 01:59:48,160
deflect. If it deflects a foot in 100 years, it's too much. If it deflects an inch in 100 years,

1080
01:59:48,160 --> 01:59:54,240
you might not want that. So the layer one of Bitcoin is a foundation upon which you put weight.

1081
01:59:54,240 --> 02:00:00,400
How much weight can you put on it? You put a trillion, 10 trillion, 100 trillion, a quadrillion.

1082
02:00:00,960 --> 02:00:07,600
How much weight's on the bedrock in Manhattan, right? Think about 100-story buildings. So

1083
02:00:07,600 --> 02:00:14,320
that the real key there is the foundational asset needs to be there at all. So the fact that you can

1084
02:00:14,320 --> 02:00:22,960
create $100 trillion layer one that would stand for 100 years, that is the revolutionary breakthrough

1085
02:00:22,960 --> 02:00:29,120
first time. And the fact that it's ethical, right? It's ethical. And it's common property, global,

1086
02:00:29,120 --> 02:00:34,480
permissionless. Extremely unlikely that would happen. People tried 50 times. People tried

1087
02:00:34,480 --> 02:00:41,280
50 times before, and they all failed. They tried 15,000 times after, and they've all generally

1088
02:00:41,280 --> 02:00:47,760
failed. 98% have failed, and a couple have been less successful. But for the most part,

1089
02:00:48,800 --> 02:00:51,760
that's an extraordinary thing. Now-

1090
02:00:51,760 --> 02:00:58,400
Just really quickly pause, just to define some terms. If people don't know, layer one that

1091
02:00:58,400 --> 02:01:05,600
Michael's referring to is in general what people know of as the Bitcoin technology originally

1092
02:01:05,600 --> 02:01:12,160
defined, which is the blockchain. There's a consensus mechanism of proof of work, a low

1093
02:01:12,160 --> 02:01:20,480
number of transactions, but you can move a very large amount of money. The reason he's using the

1094
02:01:20,480 --> 02:01:25,600
term layer one is now that there's a lot of ideas of layer two technologies built on top of this

1095
02:01:25,600 --> 02:01:36,240
bedrock that allow you to move a much larger number of transactions, sort of higher frequency.

1096
02:01:36,240 --> 02:01:41,440
I don't know what terminology you want to use, but basically be able to use now something that is

1097
02:01:41,440 --> 02:01:48,400
based on Bitcoin to then buy stuff, be a consumer, to transfer money, to use it as currency.

1098
02:01:49,920 --> 02:01:51,360
Just to define some terms.

1099
02:01:51,360 --> 02:02:02,800
Yeah. So the layer one is the foundation for the entire cyber economy, and we don't want it to move

1100
02:02:02,800 --> 02:02:13,440
fast. What we want is immortality, immortal, incorruptible, indestructible, right? That's what

1101
02:02:13,440 --> 02:02:18,240
you want, integrity from the layer one. Now there's layer two and layer three, and layer

1102
02:02:18,240 --> 02:02:27,360
two I would define as an open, permissionless, non-custodial protocol that uses the underlying

1103
02:02:27,360 --> 02:02:30,880
layer one token as its gas fee.

1104
02:02:30,880 --> 02:02:36,800
So what's custodial mean and how does the different markets, like is lightning network?

1105
02:02:36,800 --> 02:02:42,080
So lightning network would be an example of a layer two, non-custodial. So the lightning

1106
02:02:42,080 --> 02:02:50,720
network will sit on top of layer one, it'll sit on top of Bitcoin, and what you want to do is

1107
02:02:50,720 --> 02:02:56,480
solve the problem of, it's well and fine, I don't want to move a billion dollars every day, what I

1108
02:02:56,480 --> 02:03:03,920
want to move is five dollars a billion times a day. So if I want to move five dollars a billion

1109
02:03:03,920 --> 02:03:10,480
times a day, I don't really need to put the entire trillion-dollar-a-day, billion-dollar-a-day

1110
02:03:10,480 --> 02:03:18,320
trillion dollars of assets at risk every time I move five dollars. All I really need to do is put

1111
02:03:18,320 --> 02:03:22,720
a hundred thousand dollars in a channel or a million dollars in a channel, and then I do

1112
02:03:22,720 --> 02:03:28,000
ten million transactions where I have a million dollars at risk. And of course it's kind of

1113
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:36,320
simple, if I put, if I lower my security requirement by a factor of a million, I can

1114
02:03:36,320 --> 02:03:42,480
probably move the stuff a million times faster. And that's how lightning works. It's non-custodial

1115
02:03:42,480 --> 02:03:51,520
because there's no corporation or custodian or counterparty you're trusting. There's the risk

1116
02:03:51,520 --> 02:04:00,400
of moving through the channel. But lightning is an example of how I go from 350,000 transactions a day

1117
02:04:00,400 --> 02:04:06,640
to 350 million transactions a day. So on that layer too, you could move the bitcoin in seconds

1118
02:04:06,640 --> 02:04:12,640
for fractions of pennies. Now that's not the end-all be-all, because the truth is there are

1119
02:04:12,640 --> 02:04:18,880
a lot of open protocols. Lightning probably won't be the only one. There's an open market competition

1120
02:04:18,880 --> 02:04:27,920
of other permissionless open source protocols to do this work. And in theory, any other crypto

1121
02:04:27,920 --> 02:04:35,280
network that was deemed to be property, deemed to be non-security, you could also think of

1122
02:04:35,280 --> 02:04:40,320
as potentially a layer two to bitcoin, right? There's a debate about are there any and what

1123
02:04:40,320 --> 02:04:46,480
are they, and we can leave that for a later time. But why do you think of them as layer two,

1124
02:04:46,480 --> 02:04:52,480
as opposed to contending for layer one? Yeah, actually, if they're using their own token,

1125
02:04:52,480 --> 02:04:58,800
then they are a layer one. If you create an open protocol that uses the bitcoin token as the fee,

1126
02:04:58,800 --> 02:05:06,720
then it becomes a layer two. Bitcoin itself incentivizes its own transactions with its

1127
02:05:06,720 --> 02:05:12,880
own token, and that's what makes it layer one. Okay, what's layer three then?

1128
02:05:12,880 --> 02:05:19,280
Layer three is a custodial layer. So if you want to move bitcoin in milliseconds for free,

1129
02:05:19,280 --> 02:05:25,840
you move it through Binance or Coinbase or Cash App. So this is a very straightforward thing. I

1130
02:05:25,840 --> 02:05:30,640
mean, it seems pretty obvious when you think about it that there are going to be hundreds of thousands

1131
02:05:30,640 --> 02:05:37,040
of layer threes. There may be dozens of layer twos. I mean, Lightning is a one, but it's not

1132
02:05:37,040 --> 02:05:45,600
the only one. Anybody can invent something, right? And we can have this debate about custodial,

1133
02:05:45,600 --> 02:05:54,320
non-custodial. Don't you think there's a monopoly, monopolization possibilities at layer three?

1134
02:05:55,520 --> 02:06:02,480
So, you know, Coin, you mentioned Binance, Coinbase, what if they start to dominate,

1135
02:06:02,480 --> 02:06:08,320
and basically everybody's using them, practically speaking, and then it becomes too costly to

1136
02:06:08,320 --> 02:06:16,640
memorize the private key in your brain? I mean, or like the cold storage of layer one technology.

1137
02:06:16,640 --> 02:06:22,320
The idealists fear the layer threes because they think, and especially they detest,

1138
02:06:22,880 --> 02:06:28,080
they would detest it. There's almost like a layer four, by the way, if you want to.

1139
02:06:28,080 --> 02:06:33,680
A layer four would be, I've got bitcoin on an application, but I can't withdraw it.

1140
02:06:33,680 --> 02:06:37,840
So, I've got an application that's backed by bitcoin, but the bitcoin is sealed.

1141
02:06:38,640 --> 02:06:42,320
It's a proprietary example. And I'll give you an example of that. That would be like

1142
02:06:43,200 --> 02:06:52,560
Grayscale. If I own a share of GBTC, and so I own a security, actually, you know, you could own MSTR.

1143
02:06:53,360 --> 02:06:58,800
If you own a security or you own a product that has bitcoin embedded in it, you get the benefits

1144
02:06:58,800 --> 02:07:03,920
of bitcoin, but you don't have the ability to withdraw the asset.

1145
02:07:03,920 --> 02:07:08,480
So, you can have the security market at layer four? Am I understanding this correctly?

1146
02:07:09,200 --> 02:07:16,640
I don't know if I would say, not all securities are layer four, but anything that's a proprietary

1147
02:07:16,640 --> 02:07:22,240
product based upon, with bitcoin embedded in it, where you can't withdraw the bitcoin,

1148
02:07:22,800 --> 02:07:24,880
is another application of bitcoin.

1149
02:07:24,880 --> 02:07:32,000
So, if you think about different ways you can use this, you can either stay completely on the layer

1150
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:38,480
one and use the base chain for your transactions, or you can limit yourself to layer one and layer

1151
02:07:38,480 --> 02:07:43,680
two lightning. And the purist would say, we stay there, get your bitcoin off the exchange.

1152
02:07:44,400 --> 02:07:50,720
But you could also go to the layer three. When Cash App supported bitcoin, they made it very easy

1153
02:07:50,720 --> 02:07:56,080
to buy it, and then they gave you the ability to withdraw. When PayPal, or I think Robinhood,

1154
02:07:56,080 --> 02:07:59,440
let you buy it, they wouldn't let you withdraw it, and there was a big community uproar,

1155
02:07:59,440 --> 02:08:05,120
and people want, they want these layer threes to make it possible to withdraw the bitcoin.

1156
02:08:05,120 --> 02:08:09,120
So, you can take it to your own private wallet and get it off the exchange.

1157
02:08:10,080 --> 02:08:16,560
I think the answer to the question of, well, is corruption possible? Is corruption as possible

1158
02:08:16,560 --> 02:08:22,560
in all human institutions and all governments everywhere? The difference between digital

1159
02:08:22,560 --> 02:08:28,720
property and physical property is, when you own a building in Los Angeles, and the city

1160
02:08:29,280 --> 02:08:36,160
politics turn against you, you can't move the building. And when you own a share of a security

1161
02:08:36,720 --> 02:08:42,080
that's like a US traded security, and you wish to move to some other country,

1162
02:08:42,080 --> 02:08:48,320
you can't take the security with you either. And when you own a bunch of gold and you try to get

1163
02:08:48,320 --> 02:08:56,480
through the airport, they might not let you take it. So, bitcoin is advantageous versus all those,

1164
02:08:56,480 --> 02:09:01,120
because you actually do have the option to withdraw your asset from the exchange.

1165
02:09:02,080 --> 02:09:08,400
And if you had bitcoin with Fidelity, and you had shares of stock with Fidelity, and if you had

1166
02:09:08,400 --> 02:09:17,360
bonds and sovereign debt with Fidelity, if you own some mutual funds and some other random limited

1167
02:09:17,360 --> 02:09:22,560
partnerships with Fidelity, none of those things can be removed from the custodian. But the bitcoin,

1168
02:09:22,560 --> 02:09:33,760
you can take off the exchange, you can remove from the custodian. So, there's a deterrent that's an

1169
02:09:33,760 --> 02:09:41,680
anti-corrupting element. And the phrase is an armed society is a polite society, right? Because you

1170
02:09:41,680 --> 02:09:49,920
have the optionality to withdraw all your assets from the crypto exchange, you can enforce fairness.

1171
02:09:49,920 --> 02:09:55,920
And at the point where you disagree with their policies, you can, within an hour, move your

1172
02:09:55,920 --> 02:10:03,520
assets to another counterparty or take personal custody of those assets. So, you can't move your

1173
02:10:03,520 --> 02:10:10,080
assets. And you don't have that option with most other forms of property. Maybe you don't have as

1174
02:10:10,080 --> 02:10:15,920
much optionality with any other form of property on Earth. And so, what makes digital property

1175
02:10:15,920 --> 02:10:23,680
distinct is the fact that it has the most optionality for custody. Now, coming back to

1176
02:10:23,680 --> 02:10:30,480
this digital energy issue, the real key point is the energy moves in milliseconds for free on layer

1177
02:10:30,480 --> 02:10:37,920
three's. It moves in seconds or less than seconds on layer two's. It moves in minutes on the layer

1178
02:10:37,920 --> 02:10:45,680
one. And I don't think it makes any sense to even think about trying to solve all three problems on

1179
02:10:45,680 --> 02:10:52,000
the layer one because it's impossible to achieve the security and the incorruptibility and immortality

1180
02:10:52,960 --> 02:10:57,040
if you try to build that much speed and that functionality and performance.

1181
02:10:57,040 --> 02:11:03,120
In fact, if you come back to the New York model, you really wanted a block of granite, a building,

1182
02:11:03,120 --> 02:11:09,600
and a company. That's what makes the economy, right? If I said to you, you're going to build

1183
02:11:09,600 --> 02:11:14,000
a building, but you can only have one company in it for the life of the building, it would be very

1184
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:20,640
fragile, like very brittle. What company a hundred years ago is still relevant today? You want all

1185
02:11:20,640 --> 02:11:27,680
three layers because they all oscillate at different frequencies. And there's a tendency

1186
02:11:27,680 --> 02:11:33,920
to think, well, it's got to be this L1 or that L1, not really. And sometimes people think, well,

1187
02:11:33,920 --> 02:11:43,520
I don't really want any L3. But companies, it's not an even or, companies are better than crypto

1188
02:11:43,520 --> 02:11:48,720
asset networks at certain things. If you want complexity, you want to implement complexity,

1189
02:11:48,720 --> 02:11:56,400
you want to implement compliance or customer service, right? Companies do these things well,

1190
02:11:56,400 --> 02:12:05,920
right? We know you couldn't decentralize Apple or Netflix or even YouTube. The performance wouldn't

1191
02:12:05,920 --> 02:12:13,120
be there and the subtlety wouldn't be there. And you can't really legally decentralize certain

1192
02:12:13,120 --> 02:12:18,560
forms of banking and insurance because they will become illegal in the political jurisdiction they're

1193
02:12:18,560 --> 02:12:24,480
in. So unless you're a crypto anarchist and you believe in no companies and no nation states,

1194
02:12:25,680 --> 02:12:32,640
right? Which is just not very practical, not anytime soon. Once you allow that nation states

1195
02:12:32,640 --> 02:12:41,840
will continue and companies have a role, then the layered architecture follows and the free market

1196
02:12:41,840 --> 02:12:49,920
determines who wins. For example, there are layer threes that let you acquire Bitcoin and

1197
02:12:49,920 --> 02:12:56,080
withdraw Bitcoin. There are other applications that let you acquire it but not withdraw it.

1198
02:12:56,880 --> 02:13:01,920
And they don't get the same market share, but they might give you some other advantage.

1199
02:13:02,960 --> 02:13:08,720
There are certain layer threes like Jack Dorsey's cash app where they just incorporated lightning

1200
02:13:08,720 --> 02:13:19,920
and implementation of it. So that makes it more advantageous versus an application that doesn't

1201
02:13:19,920 --> 02:13:26,880
incorporate lightning. If you think about the big picture, the big picture is 8 billion people with

1202
02:13:26,880 --> 02:13:36,320
mobile phones served by 100 million companies doing billions of transactions an hour. And the

1203
02:13:36,320 --> 02:13:43,120
companies are settling with each other on the base layer in blocks of 80 million at a time.

1204
02:13:43,920 --> 02:13:53,200
And then the companies are trading with the consumers in proprietary layers like layer three.

1205
02:13:53,200 --> 02:14:00,640
And then on occasion, people are shuffling assets across custodians with lightning layer two because

1206
02:14:00,640 --> 02:14:06,800
you don't want to pay $5 to move $50. You want to pay a 20th of a penny to move $50.

1207
02:14:07,600 --> 02:14:14,720
And so all of these things create efficiency in the economy. And Lex, if you want to consider

1208
02:14:14,720 --> 02:14:21,120
how much efficiency, if you gave me a billion dollars in 20 years, I couldn't find a way to

1209
02:14:21,120 --> 02:14:29,520
trade with another company or a counterparty in Nigeria. Like no other company in the world

1210
02:14:29,520 --> 02:14:37,200
would. No amount of money. Give me $10 billion. I couldn't do it because you get shut down at the

1211
02:14:37,200 --> 02:14:44,000
banking level. You can't link up a bank in Nigeria with a bank in the US. You get shut down at this

1212
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:48,960
credit card level because they don't have the credit card, so they won't clear. You get shut

1213
02:14:48,960 --> 02:14:58,960
down at the compliance FCPA level because you wouldn't be able to implement a system that

1214
02:14:58,960 --> 02:15:02,720
interfaced with somebody else's system if it's not in the right political jurisdiction.

1215
02:15:04,080 --> 02:15:09,920
On the other hand, three entrepreneurs in Nigeria on the weekend could create a website that would

1216
02:15:09,920 --> 02:15:15,440
trade in this lightning economy using open protocols without asking anybody's permission.

1217
02:15:16,320 --> 02:15:22,400
So you're talking about something that's like a million times cheaper, less friction and faster

1218
02:15:22,960 --> 02:15:26,880
to do it if you want to get money to move.

1219
02:15:26,880 --> 02:15:31,120
LW- What do you think that looks like so that now there's a war going on in Ukraine,

1220
02:15:31,760 --> 02:15:40,800
there's other wars, Yemen going out throughout the world, in this most difficult of states that a

1221
02:15:40,800 --> 02:15:48,320
nation can be in, which is at war, civil war or war with other nations. What's the role of Bitcoin

1222
02:15:49,200 --> 02:15:50,160
in this context?

1223
02:15:50,160 --> 02:15:57,200
FCPA- Bitcoin is a universal trust protocol, a universal energy protocol, if you will.

1224
02:15:58,320 --> 02:16:05,040
English is one. What I see is a bunch of fragmentation of applications. For example,

1225
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:10,800
the Russian payment app is not going to work in Ukraine. The Ukraine payment app is not going to

1226
02:16:10,800 --> 02:16:16,400
work in Russia. The US payment apps won't work either of those places as far as I know.

1227
02:16:16,400 --> 02:16:25,120
And in Argentina, their payment app may not work in certain parts of Africa. So what you have is

1228
02:16:27,280 --> 02:16:32,640
different local economies where people spin up their own applications compliant

1229
02:16:33,360 --> 02:16:40,880
with their own local laws or in war zones not compliant but just spinning up.

1230
02:16:40,880 --> 02:16:43,760
LW- So how do you build something that's not compliant?

1231
02:16:43,760 --> 02:16:50,480
FCPA- What is the revolutionary act here when you don't agree with the government

1232
02:16:50,480 --> 02:16:56,080
or you want to free yourself from the constraint? So here's the thing, when a nation is really at

1233
02:16:56,080 --> 02:17:02,960
war, especially if it's an authoritarian regime, it's going to try to control the

1234
02:17:02,960 --> 02:17:07,600
public, lock everything down. The spread of information, how do you break through that?

1235
02:17:07,600 --> 02:17:11,760
Do you do the thing that you mentioned, which is you have to build another app essentially

1236
02:17:11,760 --> 02:17:18,080
that allows the flow of money outside the legal constraints placed on you by the government. So

1237
02:17:18,080 --> 02:17:24,000
basically break the law. Is that possible? LW- Metaphorically speaking, if you want to

1238
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:28,640
break out of the constraints of your culture, you learn to speak English. For example, it's not

1239
02:17:28,640 --> 02:17:34,560
illegal to speak English or even if it is, right? It doesn't matter. But English works everywhere

1240
02:17:34,560 --> 02:17:40,880
in the world if you can speak it and then you can tap into a global commerce and intelligence

1241
02:17:40,880 --> 02:17:46,560
network. So Bitcoin is a language. So you learn to speak Bitcoin or you learn to speak lightning

1242
02:17:47,120 --> 02:17:52,480
and then you tap into that network in whatever manner you can.

1243
02:17:52,480 --> 02:17:58,160
FCPA- But the problem is it's still very difficult to move Bitcoin around in Russia and Ukraine now

1244
02:17:58,160 --> 02:18:05,600
during the war. And there was a sense to me that the cryptocurrency in general could be the savior

1245
02:18:05,600 --> 02:18:11,760
for helping people. There's millions of refugees that are moving all around. It's very, it's very

1246
02:18:11,760 --> 02:18:16,880
difficult to move money around in that space to help people.

1247
02:18:17,440 --> 02:18:22,400
LW- I think we're very early. Like, like we're very embryonic here. If you look at the-

1248
02:18:22,400 --> 02:18:27,520
FCPA- Who's we, sorry? We as a human civilization or we operating in the cryptocurrency space?

1249
02:18:27,520 --> 02:18:34,000
LW- I think the entire crypto economy is very embryonic and the human race's

1250
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:39,680
adoption of it is embryonic. We're like one, 2% down that adoption curve.

1251
02:18:41,360 --> 02:18:46,240
If you take lightning, for example, the, you know, the first real commercial applications

1252
02:18:46,240 --> 02:18:52,000
of lightning are just in the last 12 months. So we're like year one, we might be approaching

1253
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:55,840
year two of commercial lightning adoption. And if you look at lightning adoption,

1254
02:18:56,880 --> 02:19:02,640
lightning's not built into Coinbase, it's not built into Binance, it's not built into FTX.

1255
02:19:02,640 --> 02:19:08,640
It's, you know, Cash App just implemented the first implementation, but not all the features

1256
02:19:08,640 --> 02:19:14,080
are built into it. There's a few dozen, a dozen lightning wallets circulating out there.

1257
02:19:15,120 --> 02:19:20,880
So I think that, you know, we're probably going to be 36 months of software development

1258
02:19:21,920 --> 02:19:30,240
at the point that every Android phone and every iPhone has a Bitcoin wallet or crypto

1259
02:19:30,240 --> 02:19:37,280
wallet in it of sorts. That's a big deal. If Apple embraced lightning, that's a big deal.

1260
02:19:37,280 --> 02:19:45,680
LW- So the adoption is the thing, like in a war zone adoption, the people who struggle the most

1261
02:19:45,680 --> 02:19:51,520
in war are people who weren't doing that great before the war started. They don't have the

1262
02:19:51,520 --> 02:19:56,000
technological sophistication. The hackers and all those kinds of people will find a way.

1263
02:19:56,000 --> 02:20:01,920
LW- It's just regular people who are just struggling to make day by day living. And so

1264
02:20:01,920 --> 02:20:09,840
if the adoption permeates the entire culture, then you can start to move money around in the

1265
02:20:09,840 --> 02:20:16,240
digital space. What if from a psycho, if you can psychoanalyze Jack Dorsey for a second.

1266
02:20:17,200 --> 02:20:21,920
So he's one of the early adopters, or he's one of the people pushing the early adoption, this layer

1267
02:20:21,920 --> 02:20:30,320
three. So inside Cash App, what do you make of the man of this decision as a business owner,

1268
02:20:31,200 --> 02:20:38,800
as somebody playing in the space? Like what, why did he do it? And what does that mean for others

1269
02:20:39,600 --> 02:20:43,360
at the scale that might be doing the same? So incorporating lightning networking,

1270
02:20:43,360 --> 02:20:45,680
incorporating Bitcoin into their products.

1271
02:20:45,680 --> 02:20:51,760
LW- I think he's been pretty clear about this. He feels that Bitcoin is an instrument of economic

1272
02:20:51,760 --> 02:20:58,560
empowerment for billions of people that are unbanked and have no property rights in the world.

1273
02:20:59,600 --> 02:21:10,960
If you want to give an incorruptible bank to 8 billion people on the planet,

1274
02:21:12,560 --> 02:21:20,640
that's the same as asking the question, how do you give a full education through PhD to 8 billion

1275
02:21:20,640 --> 02:21:28,720
people on the planet? And the answer is a digital version of the 20th century thing running on a

1276
02:21:28,720 --> 02:21:34,480
mobile phone. And Bitcoin is a bank in cyberspace. It's run by incorruptible software and it's for

1277
02:21:34,480 --> 02:21:39,360
everybody on earth. So I think when Jack looks at it, he's very sensitive to the plight of everybody

1278
02:21:39,360 --> 02:21:44,240
in Africa. If you look at Africans, right, like you're going to give them banks, you're not going

1279
02:21:44,240 --> 02:21:48,560
to put a bank branch on every corner. That's an obscene waste of energy. You're not going to run

1280
02:21:48,560 --> 02:21:54,240
copper wires across the continent. That's an obscene waste of energy. You're not going to

1281
02:21:54,960 --> 02:22:02,720
give them gold and, you know. So how are you going to provide people with a decent life?

1282
02:22:03,840 --> 02:22:09,040
The metaphor I think is relevant here, the biological metaphor, lacks is type 1 diabetic.

1283
02:22:10,160 --> 02:22:14,000
If you're a type 1 diabetic, you can't form fat. And if you can't form fat,

1284
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:20,640
then you can't store excess energy. So that means that, I mean, fat is the ultimate organic battery

1285
02:22:20,640 --> 02:22:26,480
and if you've got 30 pounds of it, you can go 60 days without eating. But if you can't generate

1286
02:22:26,480 --> 02:22:31,600
insulin, you can't form fat cells. And if you can't form fat cells and store energy,

1287
02:22:31,600 --> 02:22:36,640
then you can eat yourself to death. I mean, you will eat and you will die. You'll starve to death.

1288
02:22:36,640 --> 02:22:44,320
So the lack of property rights is like being a type 1 diabetic. And so if you look at most people

1289
02:22:44,320 --> 02:22:51,680
everywhere in the world, they don't have property rights, they don't have effective bank, and they

1290
02:22:51,680 --> 02:22:57,760
don't, and their currency is broken. Like what are the two things that in theory would serve

1291
02:22:57,760 --> 02:23:05,040
as the equivalent of an organic battery or an economic battery to civilization? It would be

1292
02:23:05,040 --> 02:23:14,400
I have a currency which holds its value and I can store it in a bank. So a risk-free currency

1293
02:23:14,400 --> 02:23:21,360
derivative. I pay you your money, you take your life savings, you put it in a bank, you save up

1294
02:23:21,360 --> 02:23:26,800
for your retirement, you'll have happily ever after. That's the American dream, right? That's

1295
02:23:26,800 --> 02:23:33,600
the idyllic situation. The real situation is there are no banks, you can't get a bank account,

1296
02:23:33,600 --> 02:23:39,760
so I give you your pay in currency and then I double the supply and I give it to my cousin

1297
02:23:40,320 --> 02:23:45,520
or I give it to whatever cause I want or I use it to buy weapons and then you find a loaf of bread

1298
02:23:45,520 --> 02:23:52,000
cost triple next month is what it costs and your life savings is worthless. And so in that

1299
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:58,480
environment, everybody's ripped back to Stone Age barter. And the problem with that even Stone Age

1300
02:23:58,480 --> 02:24:06,640
barter is you're gonna carry your life savings on your back and what happens when the guy with the

1301
02:24:06,640 --> 02:24:12,160
machine gun points it at your head and just takes your life savings. So I think from Jack's point of

1302
02:24:12,160 --> 02:24:19,600
view, he thinks that life is, this is maybe too strong, but these are my words, life is hopeless

1303
02:24:19,600 --> 02:24:30,320
and Bitcoin is hope, right? Because it gives everyone an engineered monetary asset that's

1304
02:24:30,320 --> 02:24:38,800
a bearer instrument and it gives them a bank on their mobile phone and they don't have to

1305
02:24:38,800 --> 02:24:49,040
trust their government or another counterparty with their life force. So there's a secondary

1306
02:24:49,040 --> 02:24:54,320
thing I think he's interested in, which is the first thing is the human rights issue and the

1307
02:24:54,320 --> 02:25:06,880
second thing would be the friction to trade cross borders is so great, right? You're like AI,

1308
02:25:07,520 --> 02:25:14,240
so I'll give you a beautiful notion. Maybe one day there'll be an artificially intelligent

1309
02:25:14,240 --> 02:25:28,080
creature in cyberspace that is self-sufficient and rich. Can a robot own money or property?

1310
02:25:28,800 --> 02:25:34,640
How about can a Tesla car? Can I actually put enough money in a car for it to drive itself and

1311
02:25:34,640 --> 02:25:40,880
maintain itself forever? Or can I create an artificially intelligent creature in cyberspace

1312
02:25:40,880 --> 02:25:47,280
that is endowed such that it would live a thousand years and continue to do its job, right?

1313
02:25:48,640 --> 02:25:53,440
We have a word for that in the real world is institution, Harvard, Cambridge, Stanford,

1314
02:25:53,440 --> 02:25:59,600
right? There are institutions with endowments that go on in perpetuity, but what if I wanted

1315
02:25:59,600 --> 02:26:10,160
to perpetuate a software program? And with something like digital property with Bitcoin

1316
02:26:10,160 --> 02:26:18,880
and lightning, you could do it. And on the other hand, with banks and credit cards,

1317
02:26:19,680 --> 02:26:25,600
you couldn't, right? You couldn't ever. So you can create things that are beautiful

1318
02:26:26,880 --> 02:26:35,360
and lasting. And what's the difference in speed? Well, so I can either trade with everybody in

1319
02:26:35,360 --> 02:26:43,920
the world at the speed of light, friction-free in 24 hours writing a Python script, or I can

1320
02:26:43,920 --> 02:26:49,920
spend a hundred billion dollars to trade with a few million people in the world after it takes

1321
02:26:49,920 --> 02:26:59,440
them six months of application. The impedance is like a 10 million to one difference, right?

1322
02:26:59,440 --> 02:27:06,240
And the metaphors are literally like launching something in orbit versus almost orbit or vacuum

1323
02:27:06,240 --> 02:27:12,080
sealing something. Does it last forever and does it orbit forever or does it go up and come down

1324
02:27:12,080 --> 02:27:21,360
and burn up, right? And I think Jack is interested in putting freedom in orbit, right?

1325
02:27:21,360 --> 02:27:23,040
Putting freedom.

1326
02:27:23,040 --> 02:27:26,480
Putting freedom in orbit. And he said it many times, he said,

1327
02:27:26,480 --> 02:27:34,640
this is the internet needs a native currency, right? And no political construct or security

1328
02:27:35,360 --> 02:27:40,880
can be a native currency. You need a property and you need a property that can be moved a million

1329
02:27:40,880 --> 02:27:47,520
times a second. Can you oscillate it at 10 kilohertz or a hundred kilohertz? And the answer

1330
02:27:47,520 --> 02:27:56,480
is only if it's a pure digital construct, permissionless and open. And so I think he's

1331
02:27:56,480 --> 02:28:02,800
enthusiastic as the technologist and he's enthusiastic as the humanitarian. And what he's

1332
02:28:02,800 --> 02:28:08,720
doing is support both those areas. He's supporting the Bitcoin and the lightning protocol by building

1333
02:28:08,720 --> 02:28:15,440
them into his products, but he's also building the applications which you need at the cash app level

1334
02:28:15,440 --> 02:28:20,560
in order to commercialize and deliver the functionality and the compliance necessary.

1335
02:28:20,560 --> 02:28:22,400
And they're related.

1336
02:28:23,760 --> 02:28:30,880
And I should also say he's just a fascinating person. For a random reason that I couldn't

1337
02:28:30,880 --> 02:28:37,360
even explain if I tried, I met him a few days ago and gave him a great big hug in the middle

1338
02:28:37,360 --> 02:28:43,120
of nowhere. There was no explanation. He just appeared. That's a fascinating human. His

1339
02:28:43,120 --> 02:28:48,560
relationship with art, with the world, with human suffering, with technology is fascinating.

1340
02:28:50,080 --> 02:28:55,520
I don't know what his path looks like, but it's interesting that people like that exist.

1341
02:28:56,880 --> 02:29:03,840
And in part, I'm saddened that he no longer is involved with Twitter directly as a CEO because

1342
02:29:03,840 --> 02:29:10,960
I was hoping something inside Twitter would also integrate some of these ideas of what you're

1343
02:29:10,960 --> 02:29:17,440
calling digital energy to see how social networks, something I'm really interested in and passionate

1344
02:29:17,440 --> 02:29:25,920
about, could be transformed. Let me ask you just for educational purposes, can you please

1345
02:29:25,920 --> 02:29:32,160
explain to me what Web3 and the beef between Jack and Marc Andreessen is exactly? Did you see what

1346
02:29:32,160 --> 02:29:38,640
happened? Sorry to have you analyze Twitter like it's Shakespeare, but can you please explain to

1347
02:29:38,640 --> 02:29:47,840
me why there was any drama over this topic? First of all, Web3 is a term that's used to refer to

1348
02:29:48,880 --> 02:29:54,800
the part of the economy that's token financed. So if I'm launching an application and my idea

1349
02:29:54,800 --> 02:30:01,040
is to create a token along with the application and issue the token to the community so as to

1350
02:30:01,040 --> 02:30:09,440
finance the application and build support for it, I think that that's the most common interpretation

1351
02:30:09,440 --> 02:30:14,320
of Web3. There are other interpretations too. So I'm just going to refer to that one.

1352
02:30:14,320 --> 02:30:19,360
And I think the beef, in a nutshell, not articulated, but I'll articulate it, is

1353
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:26,320
whether or not you should focus all your energy creating applications on top of an ethical digital

1354
02:30:26,320 --> 02:30:34,640
property like Bitcoin, or whether you should attempt to create a competitor to it, which

1355
02:30:35,440 --> 02:30:41,520
generally would be deemed as a security by the Bitcoin community. So I'm going to put on my

1356
02:30:41,520 --> 02:30:47,920
Bitcoin hat here. All the tokens, if it's driven by a venture capitalist, well, it's a security.

1357
02:30:47,920 --> 02:30:54,400
If there's a CEO and a CTO, it's a security. All these projects, they're companies. Foundations

1358
02:30:54,400 --> 02:30:58,880
are companies, right? If you call them a project or a foundation, it doesn't make it

1359
02:30:59,520 --> 02:31:06,560
not a security. They're all in essence collections of individuals that are issuing equity in the form

1360
02:31:06,560 --> 02:31:19,760
of a token. And if there's a pre-mine, an IPO, an ICO, a foundation, or any kind of protocol

1361
02:31:19,760 --> 02:31:28,080
where there's a group of engineers that have influence over it, then to a securities lawyer,

1362
02:31:28,080 --> 02:31:33,680
or to most Bitcoiners and definitely to anybody that's steeped in securities law, you look at it

1363
02:31:33,680 --> 02:31:40,640
and say, well, that passes the Howey test. It looks like a security. It should be sold to the

1364
02:31:40,640 --> 02:31:48,960
public pursuant to disclosures and regulations. And you're just ducking the IPO process,

1365
02:31:48,960 --> 02:31:57,280
right? And so now we get back to the ethical issue. The ethical issue is if you're trading it

1366
02:31:57,280 --> 02:32:03,520
as a commodity and representing it as a commodity while truthfully it's a security, then it's a

1367
02:32:03,520 --> 02:32:08,160
violation of ethics rules and it's probably illegal. Well, you keep leaning on this. Let

1368
02:32:08,160 --> 02:32:12,640
me push back on that part. Maybe you can educate me, but you keep leaning on this line of securities

1369
02:32:12,640 --> 02:32:22,800
law as if it would all do respect to lawyers, as if that line somehow defines what is and isn't

1370
02:32:22,800 --> 02:32:29,200
ethical. I think there's a lot of correlation as you've discussed, but I'd like to leave the line

1371
02:32:29,200 --> 02:32:37,920
aside. If the law calls something a security, it doesn't mean in my eyes that it is unethical. I

1372
02:32:37,920 --> 02:32:42,720
mean, there could be some technicalities and lawyers and people play games with this kind of

1373
02:32:42,720 --> 02:32:47,920
stuff all the time. But I take your bigger point that if there's a CEO, if there's a project lead,

1374
02:32:47,920 --> 02:32:53,520
that's fundamentally, well, that to you is fundamentally different than the structure of

1375
02:32:53,520 --> 02:32:58,400
Bitcoin. It's not that creating securities is unethical. I created a security. I took a company

1376
02:32:58,400 --> 02:33:04,160
public, right? That's not the unethical part. It's completely ethical to create securities.

1377
02:33:04,160 --> 02:33:09,600
You know, block is a security. All companies are securities. The unethical part is to

1378
02:33:09,600 --> 02:33:15,840
represent it as property when it's a security and to promote it or trade it as such.

1379
02:33:16,560 --> 02:33:25,840
This whole promotion, that's also a technical thing because what counts not as promotion

1380
02:33:25,840 --> 02:33:31,360
is a legal thing and you get in trouble for all these things, but that's the game that lawyers

1381
02:33:31,360 --> 02:33:36,560
play. There's an ethical thing here, which is like, what's right to promote and not, you know?

1382
02:33:37,840 --> 02:33:42,400
To me, propaganda is unethical, but it's usually not illegal.

1383
02:33:44,400 --> 02:33:47,040
If you roll the clock back 20 years,

1384
02:33:47,840 --> 02:33:52,880
right? All the boiler room pump and dump schemes were all about someone pitching a penny stock,

1385
02:33:52,880 --> 02:33:59,600
you know, selling Swampland in Florida. And if you roll the clock back forward 20 years

1386
02:33:59,600 --> 02:34:05,200
and I create my own company and I represent it as the same thing and I don't make the disclosures,

1387
02:34:05,200 --> 02:34:12,160
right? You're just one step removed from the boiler room scheme and that's what's distasteful

1388
02:34:12,160 --> 02:34:18,880
about it. There are ways to sell securities to the public, but there are expectations. Maybe

1389
02:34:20,160 --> 02:34:25,760
we could forget about whether the security laws are ethical or not, right? I will leave that alone.

1390
02:34:25,760 --> 02:34:32,800
We'll just start with the biblical definition of ethics. Don't lie, cheat or steal. So if I'm going

1391
02:34:32,800 --> 02:34:41,040
to sell something to you, I need to fully disclose what I'm selling to you, right? And that's a

1392
02:34:41,040 --> 02:34:47,440
matter of great debate right now. And so I think that that's part of the debate. But the other

1393
02:34:47,440 --> 02:34:58,240
part of the debate is whether or not we need more than one token. Like we need at least one,

1394
02:34:58,240 --> 02:35:05,440
right? We need at least one digital property because zero means there is no digital economy.

1395
02:35:05,440 --> 02:35:10,880
Yes. And by the way, you know, the conventional view of maximalists is they think there's only

1396
02:35:10,880 --> 02:35:16,080
one and everything else isn't. That's not the point I'm going to make. I would say we know

1397
02:35:16,080 --> 02:35:24,880
there is at least one digital property and that is Bitcoin. If you can create a truly decentralized,

1398
02:35:24,880 --> 02:35:33,920
non-custodial, you know, bearer instrument that is not under the control of any organization

1399
02:35:34,480 --> 02:35:40,880
that is fairly distributed, then you might create another or multiple and there may be others out

1400
02:35:40,880 --> 02:35:50,560
there. But I think that the frustration of a lot of people in the Bitcoin community, and I share

1401
02:35:50,560 --> 02:35:56,480
this with Jack, is we could create 100 trillion dollars of value in the real world simply by

1402
02:35:56,480 --> 02:36:04,640
building applications on top of Bitcoin as a foundation. And so continually trying to reinvent

1403
02:36:04,640 --> 02:36:15,600
the wheel and create competitive things is a massive waste of time and it's diversion of

1404
02:36:17,840 --> 02:36:25,440
human creativity. It's like we have an ethical good thing and now we're going to try to create

1405
02:36:25,440 --> 02:36:31,920
a third or a fourth one. Why? Well, let's talk about it. So first of all, I'm with you, but

1406
02:36:31,920 --> 02:36:37,040
let me ask you this interesting question because we talked about properties and securities. Let's

1407
02:36:37,040 --> 02:36:43,440
talk about conflict of interest. So you said you could advertise, you have a popular Twitter account.

1408
02:36:44,240 --> 02:36:52,960
It's hilarious and insightful. You do promote Bitcoin in a sense. I don't know if you would

1409
02:36:52,960 --> 02:36:59,040
say that. But do you think there's a conflict of interest in anyone who owns Bitcoin promoting

1410
02:36:59,040 --> 02:37:06,720
Bitcoin? Is it the same as you promoting the farming? I would say no, there's an interest.

1411
02:37:08,400 --> 02:37:18,160
I think that you can promote a property or an idea to the extent that you don't control it.

1412
02:37:18,880 --> 02:37:25,440
I think that the point at which you start to have a conflict of interest is when you're promoting

1413
02:37:25,440 --> 02:37:31,280
a proprietary product or a proprietary security. A security in general is a proprietary asset.

1414
02:37:32,080 --> 02:37:37,520
So for example, if you look at my Twitter, you will find that I make lots of statements about

1415
02:37:37,520 --> 02:37:42,720
Bitcoin. You won't ever see me making a statement that say microstrategy stock will go up forever.

1416
02:37:43,600 --> 02:37:51,600
I'm not promoting a security MSTR because at the end of the day, MSTR is a security. It is

1417
02:37:51,600 --> 02:37:58,320
proprietary. I have proprietary interest in it. I have a disproportionate amount of control

1418
02:37:58,320 --> 02:38:03,840
and influence on the direction. The control is the problem. The control is the problem

1419
02:38:03,840 --> 02:38:11,200
because you have interest in both. If Bitcoin is as successful as we're talking about,

1420
02:38:11,200 --> 02:38:18,160
you are very possibly can become the richest human on earth given how much you own in Bitcoin.

1421
02:38:18,160 --> 02:38:21,840
Right? The wealthiest, not the richest. I don't know what those words mean.

1422
02:38:22,480 --> 02:38:24,880
I would benefit economically.

1423
02:38:24,880 --> 02:38:26,240
You would benefit economically.

1424
02:38:26,240 --> 02:38:26,880
That's true.

1425
02:38:26,880 --> 02:38:33,360
So the reason that's not conflict of interest is because the word property,

1426
02:38:34,320 --> 02:38:38,960
that Bitcoin is an idea and Bitcoin is open.

1427
02:38:38,960 --> 02:38:46,720
It's because I don't own it. I don't control it. In essence, the ethical line here is could I print

1428
02:38:46,720 --> 02:38:49,920
myself 10 million more Bitcoin or not? Right?

1429
02:38:51,120 --> 02:38:54,640
Or can anyone, right? It's not just you. It's can anyone?

1430
02:38:55,440 --> 02:38:58,560
Because can you promote somebody else's? Yes, I guess you can.

1431
02:38:59,600 --> 02:39:04,720
Like if you can promote us, Apple, when you have no stake.

1432
02:39:04,720 --> 02:39:11,280
You could have a Twitter account where you promote oil or you promote camping or you promote

1433
02:39:11,280 --> 02:39:16,800
family values or promote, you know, a carnivore diet or promote the Iron Man, right?

1434
02:39:17,520 --> 02:39:22,720
You're not going to get wealthier if you promote camping because you can't own a stake.

1435
02:39:24,960 --> 02:39:30,480
You own a lot of Bitcoin. What is that? What is that? Don't you own the stake in the idea?

1436
02:39:31,600 --> 02:39:33,520
Yeah, I would grant you that.

1437
02:39:34,720 --> 02:39:40,400
But the lack of control is the fundamental ethical line that you just you don't have

1438
02:39:40,400 --> 02:39:44,800
all you are is you're a fan of the idea. You believe in the idea and the power of the idea.

1439
02:39:46,240 --> 02:39:49,200
Yeah, I think you can't take that idea away from others.

1440
02:39:49,680 --> 02:39:53,440
Let's come back to let me give you some maybe easier examples.

1441
02:39:53,440 --> 02:40:01,200
If you were the head of the Marine Corps, right? And someone came to you and said,

1442
02:40:01,200 --> 02:40:08,640
I created Marine coin and the twist on Marine coin is I want you to tell every Marine that

1443
02:40:08,640 --> 02:40:13,760
they'll get an extra Marine coin, you know, when they when they get their next stripe.

1444
02:40:14,560 --> 02:40:18,160
And then I'm going to give you, you know, I'm going to let you buy Marine coin now.

1445
02:40:18,160 --> 02:40:23,200
And then after you buy Marine coin, I want you to, like, promote it to them.

1446
02:40:24,160 --> 02:40:31,040
Right. At some point, if if you start to have a disproportional influence on it,

1447
02:40:31,040 --> 02:40:35,040
or if you're in a conversation with people with disproportionate influence becomes conflict of

1448
02:40:35,040 --> 02:40:40,240
interest, and it would make you profoundly uncomfortable, I think. Yeah. If the head of

1449
02:40:40,240 --> 02:40:46,240
the Marine Corps started promoting anything that looked like a security. Now, if the head of the

1450
02:40:46,240 --> 02:40:52,080
Marine Corps started promoting canoeing. You might think he's kind of wacky, like maybe,

1451
02:40:52,720 --> 02:40:59,120
like that's kind of a waste of time and distraction. So but but but to the extent that

1452
02:40:59,120 --> 02:41:05,040
that canoeing is not a security, not a problem unless you you know, ultimately,

1453
02:41:05,040 --> 02:41:11,360
the the issue of decentralization is really a critical one. So not having a head. So is it

1454
02:41:11,360 --> 02:41:20,560
something can Bitcoin be replicated? So the all the things that you're saying that make it a

1455
02:41:20,560 --> 02:41:25,680
property, can that be replicated? Have any other... I think it's possible to create other crypto

1456
02:41:25,680 --> 02:41:33,760
properties. Does it does the having a head, like of a project, a thing that limits its ability to

1457
02:41:33,760 --> 02:41:40,400
be a property? If you if you try to replicate a project? Is that the fundamental flaw?

1458
02:41:41,520 --> 02:41:45,440
Look, I think the real fundamental issue is you just never want it to change.

1459
02:41:46,560 --> 02:41:54,080
Like, like, if you really want something decentralized, you want a genetic template

1460
02:41:54,080 --> 02:42:00,480
that substantially is not going to change for a thousand years. So I think Satoshi said at one

1461
02:42:00,480 --> 02:42:05,920
point, he said the nature of the software is such that by version point one, its genetic code was

1462
02:42:05,920 --> 02:42:12,880
set. If if there was any development team that's continually changing it, you know, on a routine

1463
02:42:12,880 --> 02:42:19,760
basis, it becomes harder and harder to maintain its decentralization because now now there's the

1464
02:42:19,760 --> 02:42:30,000
issue of who's influencing the changes. So what you really want is is a very, very simple idea,

1465
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:35,200
right? The simplest idea. I'm just going to keep track of who owns 21 million parts of energy.

1466
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:42,560
And when someone proposes big functional upgrades, you almost don't you don't really want that

1467
02:42:42,560 --> 02:42:46,960
development to go on the base layer. You want that development to go on the layer threes because

1468
02:42:46,960 --> 02:42:53,760
now cash app has a proprietary set of functionality and it's a security. And if you're going to

1469
02:42:53,760 --> 02:43:00,400
promote the use of this thing, you're not going to you're not going to promote the layer three

1470
02:43:00,400 --> 02:43:06,000
security because that's a an edge to a given entity and you're trusting the counterparty,

1471
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:10,800
you're going to promote the layer one or at most the layer two.

1472
02:43:10,800 --> 02:43:18,400
Okay, so one of the fascinating things about Bitcoin, and sorry to romanticize certain notions,

1473
02:43:18,400 --> 02:43:24,960
but Satoshi Nakamoto, that the founder is anonymous. Maybe you can speak to whether that's

1474
02:43:25,520 --> 02:43:30,960
useful, but also I just like the psychology of that to imagine that there's a human being that

1475
02:43:30,960 --> 02:43:36,720
was able to create something special and walk away. So first are you Satoshi Nakamoto?

1476
02:43:36,720 --> 02:43:45,680
I'm certain I'm not. No, actually, I, you know, I think the providence is really important. And

1477
02:43:45,680 --> 02:43:51,680
if I were to look at the highlighted points, I think having a founder that was anonymous or

1478
02:43:51,680 --> 02:43:56,960
synonymous is important. I think the founder disappearing is also important. I think that

1479
02:43:56,960 --> 02:44:03,760
the fact that the Satoshi coins never moved is also important. I think the the last thing that

1480
02:44:03,760 --> 02:44:10,880
is also important. I think the lack of an initial coin offering is also important. I think the lack

1481
02:44:10,880 --> 02:44:17,840
of a corporate sponsor is important. I think the fact that it traded for 15 months with no commercial

1482
02:44:17,840 --> 02:44:29,120
value was also important. You know, I think that the simplicity of the protocol is very important.

1483
02:44:29,120 --> 02:44:35,120
I think that the outcome of the block size wars is very important. And all of those things

1484
02:44:36,320 --> 02:44:43,920
add up to common property. They're all indicia, indicators of a digital property as opposed to

1485
02:44:43,920 --> 02:44:51,520
security. If there was a Satoshi sitting around sitting on top of $50 billion worth of Bitcoin,

1486
02:44:51,520 --> 02:44:59,360
it would I don't think it would cripple Bitcoin as property, but I think it would undermine

1487
02:45:00,720 --> 02:45:05,520
its digital property. And if I wanted to undermine a crypto asset network,

1488
02:45:05,520 --> 02:45:11,360
I would do the opposite of all those things. I would launch one myself. I would sell 25 percent

1489
02:45:11,360 --> 02:45:16,480
or 50 percent of the general public. I would keep some of the initial I would pre mine some stuff

1490
02:45:16,480 --> 02:45:23,360
or early mine it, you know, and I would keep an influence on it. Those are all the opposite

1491
02:45:23,360 --> 02:45:31,120
of what you would do in order to create common property. And so I see the entire story as Satoshi

1492
02:45:31,120 --> 02:45:37,920
giving a gift of digital property to the human race and disappearing.

1493
02:45:38,560 --> 02:45:41,680
Do you think it was one person? Do you have ideas of who it could be?

1494
02:45:41,680 --> 02:45:44,160
I don't care to speculate.

1495
02:45:44,160 --> 02:45:46,960
Okay. But do you think it was one person?

1496
02:45:48,160 --> 02:45:52,000
It was one person, maybe in conjunction with a bunch of others. I mean,

1497
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:56,240
it might have been a group of people that were working together, but certainly there's a Satoshi.

1498
02:45:56,240 --> 02:46:02,160
I mean, it's just so fascinating to me that one person could be so brave and thoughtful. Or do

1499
02:46:02,160 --> 02:46:07,360
you think a lot of his accent, like the block size wars, the decision to make a block a certain size,

1500
02:46:07,360 --> 02:46:13,040
all all the things you mentioned led up to the characteristics that make Bitcoin property.

1501
02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:18,160
Do you think that's an accident or it was deeply thought through?

1502
02:46:18,160 --> 02:46:20,800
Like, how does this is almost like a history of science question.

1503
02:46:20,800 --> 02:46:24,800
I think people tried it for they tried 40 of them, right? I mean, I think there's a there's

1504
02:46:24,800 --> 02:46:29,120
a history of attempting to create something like this. And it was tried many, many times and,

1505
02:46:29,520 --> 02:46:34,880
and they failed for different reasons. And I think that it's like Prometheus tried to start a fire

1506
02:46:34,880 --> 02:46:41,040
47 times and maybe the 48th time it sparked. And that's how I see this. This is the first one that

1507
02:46:41,040 --> 02:46:50,000
sparked. And it sets a roadmap for us. And I think if you're looking for any one word that

1508
02:46:50,000 --> 02:46:54,880
characterizes it, it's fair, right? The whole point of the network is it's a fair launch,

1509
02:46:54,880 --> 02:47:05,280
a fair distribution. Like, yeah, I have Bitcoin, but I bought it. In fact, you know,

1510
02:47:05,280 --> 02:47:13,760
at this point, we've paid $4 billion of you real cash to buy it. If I was sitting on the same

1511
02:47:13,760 --> 02:47:19,760
position, and I had it for free, then there's always this question of, did I, you know,

1512
02:47:19,760 --> 02:47:25,360
or I bought it for a nickel, a coin or a penny, the question is, was it fair? And that's a very

1513
02:47:25,360 --> 02:47:33,280
hard question to answer, right? Did you acquire the Bitcoin that you own fairly? And if you roll

1514
02:47:33,280 --> 02:47:37,840
the clock back, you know, you could have bought it for a nickel or a dime, but that was when it

1515
02:47:37,840 --> 02:47:44,560
was a million times more likely to fail, right? When the risk was greater, the cost was lower.

1516
02:47:44,560 --> 02:47:51,840
And then over time, the risk became lower and the cost became greater. And the real critical thing

1517
02:47:51,840 --> 02:48:00,640
was to allow the marketplace absent any powerful interested actor, right? If Satoshi had held a

1518
02:48:00,640 --> 02:48:05,920
million coins and then stayed engaged for 10 more years, tweaking things in the background,

1519
02:48:05,920 --> 02:48:11,600
there'd still be that question. But what we've got is really a beautiful thing. We've got a

1520
02:48:11,600 --> 02:48:19,120
we've got a chain reaction in cyberspace or an ideology spreading virally in the world

1521
02:48:20,560 --> 02:48:29,360
that has seasoned in a fair ethical fashion. Sometimes it's a very violent, brutal fashion

1522
02:48:29,360 --> 02:48:35,120
with all the volatility, right? And there's been a lot of, you know, a lot of sound and fury along

1523
02:48:35,120 --> 02:48:41,920
the way. How do you psychoanalyze? How do you deal from a financial, from a human perspective

1524
02:48:41,920 --> 02:48:46,800
with the volatility? You mentioned you could have gotten it for a nickel and the risk was great.

1525
02:48:47,360 --> 02:48:54,000
Where's the risk today? What's your sense? You know, we're 13 years into this entire activity.

1526
02:48:54,000 --> 02:49:00,480
I think the risk has never been lower. If you look at all the risks, right? The risks in the

1527
02:49:00,480 --> 02:49:08,800
early years are, is the engineering protocol proper? Like one megabyte block size, 10 minute

1528
02:49:08,800 --> 02:49:17,760
clock frequency cryptography is first, will it be hacked or will it crash? 730,000 blocks and it

1529
02:49:17,760 --> 02:49:22,160
hasn't crashed. Will it be hacked? Hasn't been hacked. But you know, it's a Lindy thing, right?

1530
02:49:22,160 --> 02:49:27,680
You wait 13 years to see if it'll be hacked. But on the other hand, with a billion dollars,

1531
02:49:27,680 --> 02:49:32,160
it's not as interesting a target as it is with a hundred billion. And when it gets to be worth

1532
02:49:32,160 --> 02:49:41,600
a trillion, then it's a bigger target. So the risk has been bleeding off over time as the network

1533
02:49:41,600 --> 02:49:48,400
monetized. I think the second question is, will it be banned? You couldn't know. It literally could

1534
02:49:48,400 --> 02:49:54,000
have been banned many times early on. In fact, in 2013, I tweeted on that subject, I thought it would

1535
02:49:54,000 --> 02:50:01,920
be banned. I made a very infamous tweet. I thought it was going to be banned. In 2014, the IRS

1536
02:50:02,720 --> 02:50:08,720
designated it as property and gave it property tax treatment, okay? So they could have given

1537
02:50:08,720 --> 02:50:14,960
it a tax treatment where you had to pay tax on the unrealized capital gains every year and it

1538
02:50:14,960 --> 02:50:23,360
probably would have crushed it to death, right? So it could have been in any number of places

1539
02:50:23,360 --> 02:50:29,040
banned by a government, but in fact, it was legitimized as property. And then the question

1540
02:50:29,040 --> 02:50:32,240
is, would it be hacked or would it be copied? Would it be something better than that? And it

1541
02:50:32,240 --> 02:50:39,440
was copied 15,000 times. And you know the story of all those. And they either diverged to be

1542
02:50:39,440 --> 02:50:46,400
something totally different and not comparable or someone trying to copy a non-sovereign bearer

1543
02:50:46,400 --> 02:50:53,920
instrument store of value found that their networks crashed to be 1% of what Bitcoin is. So now we're

1544
02:50:53,920 --> 02:51:00,480
sitting at a point where all those risks are out of the way. I would say that year one of

1545
02:51:00,480 --> 02:51:08,480
institutional adoption is it started August 2020. That's when MicroStrategy bought $250 million

1546
02:51:08,480 --> 02:51:13,040
worth of Bitcoin and we put that out on the wire. We were the first publicly traded company to

1547
02:51:13,040 --> 02:51:18,400
actually buy Bitcoin. I don't think you could have found a $5 million purchase from a public

1548
02:51:18,400 --> 02:51:24,880
company before we did that. So that was kind of like a gun going off. And then in the next 12

1549
02:51:24,880 --> 02:51:31,920
months, Tesla bought Bitcoin, Square bought Bitcoin. And I'd say now we're in year two

1550
02:51:31,920 --> 02:51:38,000
of institutional adoption. And there are about 24, should be 24 publicly traded Bitcoin miners

1551
02:51:38,000 --> 02:51:44,320
by the end of this quarter. So you're looking at 36 publicly traded companies and you've got

1552
02:51:47,760 --> 02:51:54,240
at least in the range of $50 billion of Bitcoin on the balance sheet of publicly traded companies

1553
02:51:54,880 --> 02:52:00,880
and hundreds of billions of dollars of market cap of Bitcoin exposed companies.

1554
02:52:00,880 --> 02:52:08,240
So I would say the asset, decade one was entrepreneurial, experimental.

1555
02:52:10,240 --> 02:52:16,320
Decade two is a rotation from entrepreneurs to institutions and is becoming institutionalized.

1556
02:52:16,320 --> 02:52:20,560
So maybe decade one you go from zero to a trillion and in decade two you go from one trillion to

1557
02:52:20,560 --> 02:52:26,320
a hundred trillion. What about governments, government adoption, institutional adoption?

1558
02:52:26,320 --> 02:52:33,920
Are governments important in this? Maybe making it some governments incorporating it into as a

1559
02:52:33,920 --> 02:52:41,360
currency into their banks, all that kind of stuff. Is that important? And if it is, when will it

1560
02:52:41,360 --> 02:52:48,880
happen? It's not essential for the success of the asset class, but I think it's inevitable in various

1561
02:52:48,880 --> 02:52:58,800
degrees over time. But the most likely thing to happen next is large acquisitions by institutional

1562
02:52:58,800 --> 02:53:06,880
investors of Bitcoin as a digital gold, where they're just swapping out gold for digital gold

1563
02:53:06,880 --> 02:53:11,280
and thinking of it like that. And the government entities most likely to be involved with that

1564
02:53:11,280 --> 02:53:15,920
would be sovereign wealth funds. If you look at all the sovereign wealth funds that are holding

1565
02:53:15,920 --> 02:53:20,960
big tech stock equities, the Swiss, the Norwegians, the Middle Easterners,

1566
02:53:22,160 --> 02:53:29,280
if you can hold big tech, then holding digital gold would be not far removed from that. That's

1567
02:53:29,280 --> 02:53:36,720
a non-controversial adoption. I think there are opportunities for governments that are

1568
02:53:36,720 --> 02:53:45,360
much more profound. If a government started to adopt Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset,

1569
02:53:45,360 --> 02:53:55,040
that's much bigger than just an asset investment. That's 100x bigger. And you could imagine that's

1570
02:53:55,040 --> 02:54:00,960
like a trillion dollar opportunity. Any government that wanted to adopt it as a treasury reserve asset

1571
02:54:00,960 --> 02:54:08,240
would probably generate trillions of dollars, a trillion or more of value. And then the thing

1572
02:54:08,240 --> 02:54:15,120
that people think about is, well, will oil ever be priced in Bitcoin or any other export commodity?

1573
02:54:16,000 --> 02:54:22,240
I think there's like $1.8 trillion or more of export commodities in the world. And right now,

1574
02:54:22,240 --> 02:54:27,200
they're all priced in dollars. I think that this is a colorful thing, but it's not really that

1575
02:54:27,200 --> 02:54:33,760
relevant. You could sell all that stuff in dollars. The relevant decision that any institution makes,

1576
02:54:33,760 --> 02:54:37,840
whether they're a nonprofit, a university, a corporation, or a government,

1577
02:54:38,560 --> 02:54:44,160
is what's your treasury reserve asset? And if your treasury reserve asset is the peso,

1578
02:54:44,160 --> 02:54:54,240
and if the peso is losing 20% or 30% of its value a year, then your balance sheet is collapsing

1579
02:54:54,240 --> 02:55:01,600
within five years. And if the treasury reserve asset is dollars and currency derivatives and

1580
02:55:01,600 --> 02:55:09,440
US treasuries, then you're getting your seven. Right now, it's probably 15% or more

1581
02:55:10,240 --> 02:55:15,040
monetary inflation. We're running double the historic average. You could argue triple,

1582
02:55:15,040 --> 02:55:21,440
somewhere between double and triple, depending upon what your metric is. So do I think it'll

1583
02:55:21,440 --> 02:55:25,040
happen? I think that they're conservative, but they have to be shocked. And I think there is a

1584
02:55:25,040 --> 02:55:33,520
shock. The late Russian sanctions are a big shock. When the West sees $300 billion worth

1585
02:55:33,520 --> 02:55:39,200
of Russian gold and currency derivatives, I think you got the famous quote by Putin that

1586
02:55:40,160 --> 02:55:47,120
we have to rethink our treasury strategies. And that pushes everybody toward a commodity strategy.

1587
02:55:47,120 --> 02:55:51,840
What commodities do I want to hold? I think that's got a lot of people thinking. I think it's got

1588
02:55:51,840 --> 02:55:58,000
the Chinese thinking. Everybody wants to be the reserve currency, right? So if I buy $50 billion

1589
02:55:58,000 --> 02:56:11,520
worth of dollars every year, then I buy $500 billion over a decade, and I probably pay $250

1590
02:56:11,520 --> 02:56:21,120
billion of inflation cost on the backs of my citizens in a decade. So inflation could be one

1591
02:56:21,120 --> 02:56:28,240
of the sources of shock. And you wonder if there is a switch to Bitcoin, whether it will be a bang

1592
02:56:28,240 --> 02:56:36,080
or a whimper. Like what is the nature of the shock or the transition? I think that the year 2022 is

1593
02:56:36,080 --> 02:56:43,280
pretty catalytic for digital assets in general and for Bitcoin in particular. The Canadian trucker

1594
02:56:43,280 --> 02:56:50,960
crisis, I think, educated hundreds of millions of people and made them start questioning their

1595
02:56:50,960 --> 02:56:59,840
property rights and their banks. I think the Ukraine war was a second shock. But I think

1596
02:56:59,840 --> 02:57:09,760
that the Russian sanctions was a third shock. I think hyperinflation in the rest of the world is

1597
02:57:09,760 --> 02:57:16,080
a fourth shock. And then persistent inflation in the US is a fifth shock. So I think it's a perfect

1598
02:57:16,080 --> 02:57:23,360
storm. And if you put all these events together, what do they signify? They signify the rational

1599
02:57:23,360 --> 02:57:30,720
conclusion for any person thinking about this is, I'm not sure if I can trust my property.

1600
02:57:31,520 --> 02:57:34,720
I don't know if I have property rights. I don't know if I can trust the bank.

1601
02:57:35,440 --> 02:57:43,120
And if I'm politically at odds with the leader of my own country, I'm going to lose my property.

1602
02:57:43,120 --> 02:57:48,880
And if I'm politically at odds with the owner of another country, I'm still going to lose my

1603
02:57:48,880 --> 02:57:55,440
property. And when push comes to shove, the banks will freeze my assets and seize them.

1604
02:57:56,240 --> 02:58:01,760
And I think that that is playing out in front of everybody in the world,

1605
02:58:03,760 --> 02:58:13,680
such that your logical response would be, I'm going to convert my weak currency to a strong

1606
02:58:13,680 --> 02:58:20,960
currency. I'll convert my peso and lira to the dollar. I'm going to convert my weak property

1607
02:58:20,960 --> 02:58:28,160
to strong property. I'm going to sell my building downtown Moscow. And I'd rather own

1608
02:58:28,960 --> 02:58:36,080
a building in New York City. I'd rather own in a powerful nation than be stuck with a building

1609
02:58:36,080 --> 02:58:42,160
in Nigeria or a building in Argentina or whatever. So I'm going to sell my weak properties by strong

1610
02:58:42,160 --> 02:58:47,760
properties. I'm going to convert my physical assets to digital assets. I'd rather own a

1611
02:58:47,760 --> 02:58:53,520
digital building than own a physical building. Because if I had a billion dollar building in

1612
02:58:53,520 --> 02:58:59,040
Moscow, who can I rent that to? But if I have a billion dollar digital building, I can rent it to

1613
02:58:59,040 --> 02:59:06,160
anybody in any city in the world, anybody with money. And the maintenance cost is almost nothing,

1614
02:59:06,160 --> 02:59:09,680
and I can hold it for 100 years. So it's an indestructible building.

1615
02:59:09,680 --> 02:59:15,920
And then finally, I want to move from having my assets in a bank with a counterparty

1616
02:59:15,920 --> 02:59:23,440
to self-custody assets. And this is not just Ukraine, but this is like the story in Turkey,

1617
02:59:23,440 --> 02:59:30,640
Lebanon, Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, South America. You don't really want to be sitting with $10

1618
02:59:30,640 --> 02:59:38,160
million in a bank in Istanbul. The bank's going to freeze your money, convert it to lira, devalue

1619
02:59:38,160 --> 02:59:42,400
the lira, and then feed it back to you over 17 years, right?

1620
02:59:42,400 --> 02:59:45,680
So self-custody assets would be layer one Bitcoin?

1621
02:59:46,480 --> 02:59:52,720
Self-custody assets, it's like, if I got my own hardware wallet, and I've either got

1622
02:59:55,040 --> 03:00:00,400
your highest form of self-custody would be Bitcoin on your own hardware wallet or Bitcoin

1623
03:00:00,400 --> 03:00:06,160
in your own self-custody. And the other thing people think about is how do I get crypto dollars

1624
03:00:06,160 --> 03:00:12,640
like Tether, like some stable coin. Like I'd rather, if you had a choice, would you rather

1625
03:00:12,640 --> 03:00:19,040
have your money in a bank in a war zone in dollars or have your money in a stable coin

1626
03:00:19,040 --> 03:00:25,840
on your mobile phone in dollars, right? I mean, you take the latter risk rather than

1627
03:00:25,840 --> 03:00:27,920
the former risk. In a war zone, definitely, yeah.

1628
03:00:28,560 --> 03:00:33,200
And you can see that happening. Like we've gone from 5 billion in stable coins to 200 billion

1629
03:00:33,200 --> 03:00:42,160
in the last 24 months. So I do think there's massive demand for crypto dollars in the form

1630
03:00:42,160 --> 03:00:48,480
of a US dollar asset. And everybody in the world would say, yeah, I want that.

1631
03:00:49,520 --> 03:00:54,000
Well, unless you're just an extreme patriot, but most people in the world would say, I

1632
03:00:54,000 --> 03:00:58,640
want that. And then a lesser group of people would say, I think I want to be able to carry

1633
03:00:58,640 --> 03:01:03,280
my property in the palm of my hand so I have self-custody of it.

1634
03:01:04,240 --> 03:01:09,280
So the Bitcoin price has gone through quite a roller coaster. What do you think is the

1635
03:01:09,280 --> 03:01:14,240
high point it's going to hit? I think it'll go forever, right? I mean,

1636
03:01:14,240 --> 03:01:21,760
I think the Bitcoin is going to climb in a serpentine fashion. It's going to advance

1637
03:01:21,760 --> 03:01:28,080
and come back and it's going to keep climbing. I think that the volatility

1638
03:01:28,080 --> 03:01:34,800
attracts all the capital into the marketplace. And so the volatility makes it the most interesting

1639
03:01:34,800 --> 03:01:40,960
thing in the financial universe. It also generates massive yield and massive returns for traders.

1640
03:01:42,080 --> 03:01:48,080
And that attracts capital. Like we're talking about the difference between 5% return and 500%

1641
03:01:48,080 --> 03:01:56,960
return. So the fast money is attracted by the volatility. The volatility has been decreasing

1642
03:01:56,960 --> 03:02:03,600
year by year by year. I think that it's stabilizing. I don't think we'll see as much

1643
03:02:03,600 --> 03:02:11,440
volatility in the future as we have in the past. I think that if we look at Bitcoin and model it as

1644
03:02:12,880 --> 03:02:20,720
digital gold, the market cap goes to between 10 and 20 trillion. But gold is, remember,

1645
03:02:20,720 --> 03:02:26,480
gold is defective property. Gold is dead money. You have a billion dollars of gold that sits in

1646
03:02:26,480 --> 03:02:31,920
a vault for a decade. It's very hard to mortgage the gold. It's also very hard to rent the gold.

1647
03:02:31,920 --> 03:02:35,920
You can't loan the gold. No one's going to create a business with your gold.

1648
03:02:36,560 --> 03:02:41,360
So gold doesn't generate much of a yield. So for that reason, most people wouldn't store

1649
03:02:41,360 --> 03:02:45,920
a billion dollars for a decade in gold. They would buy a billion dollars of commercial real estate

1650
03:02:45,920 --> 03:02:52,160
property. And the reason why is because I can rent it and generate a yield on it that's in

1651
03:02:52,160 --> 03:02:59,520
excess of the maintenance cost. So if you consider digital property, that's 100 to 200 trillion

1652
03:03:01,440 --> 03:03:06,880
addressable market. So I would think it goes from 10 trillion to 100 trillion as people start to

1653
03:03:06,880 --> 03:03:11,840
think of it as digital property. What does that mean in terms of price per coin?

1654
03:03:11,840 --> 03:03:20,880
At 500,000, that's a 10 trillion dollar asset. At 5 million, that's a 100 trillion dollar asset.

1655
03:03:20,880 --> 03:03:23,600
So I think it crosses a million. It can go even higher.

1656
03:03:24,320 --> 03:03:27,760
Yeah, I think it keeps going up forever. I mean, there's no reason it couldn't go to 10 million

1657
03:03:27,760 --> 03:03:32,480
a coin, right? Because digital property isn't the highest form, right?

1658
03:03:32,480 --> 03:03:38,800
Gold was that low frequency money. Property is a mid frequency money. But when I start to

1659
03:03:40,880 --> 03:03:50,560
program it faster, it starts to look like digital energy. And then it doesn't just replace property.

1660
03:03:50,560 --> 03:03:57,600
Then you're starting to replace bonds. It's 100 trillion in bonds, there's 50 to 100 trillion

1661
03:03:57,600 --> 03:04:04,240
in other currency derivatives. And these are all conventional use cases, right? I think that

1662
03:04:05,280 --> 03:04:13,760
there's 350 trillion to 500 trillion dollars worth of currency derivatives in the world.

1663
03:04:15,360 --> 03:04:20,000
And when I say that, I mean things that are valued based upon fiat cash flows.

1664
03:04:20,000 --> 03:04:26,160
Any commercial real estate, any bond, any sovereign debt, any currency itself,

1665
03:04:26,160 --> 03:04:32,400
any derivatives to those things, they're all derivatives. And they're all defective.

1666
03:04:32,400 --> 03:04:35,840
And they're all defective because of this persistent 7% to 14%

1667
03:04:37,760 --> 03:04:42,560
lapse, which we call inflation or monetary expansion. Can we switch,

1668
03:04:43,120 --> 03:04:47,600
so I'm just going to talk about the energy side of it, like the innovative piece.

1669
03:04:47,600 --> 03:04:50,400
Yeah. Let's just start with this idea that

1670
03:04:50,400 --> 03:04:56,480
I've got a hotel worth a billion dollars with a thousand rooms. When it becomes a dematerialized

1671
03:04:56,480 --> 03:05:00,880
hotel. I love that word so much, by the way, dematerialized hotel.

1672
03:05:00,880 --> 03:05:04,400
We're crossing the fountain blow here. Imagine the fountain blow is dematerialized.

1673
03:05:05,200 --> 03:05:10,560
The problem with a physical hotel is I got to hire real people moving subject to the speed of sound

1674
03:05:10,560 --> 03:05:15,360
and physics laws and Newton's laws. And I can rent it to people in Miami beach.

1675
03:05:15,360 --> 03:05:18,240
Mm-hmm. But if it was a digital hotel,

1676
03:05:18,240 --> 03:05:22,240
I could rent the room to people in Paris, London, and New York every night.

1677
03:05:23,200 --> 03:05:27,760
And I can run it with robots. And as soon as I do that, I can rent it by the room hour.

1678
03:05:28,320 --> 03:05:33,840
And I can rent it by the room minute. And so I start to chop my hotel up into

1679
03:05:34,560 --> 03:05:42,000
100,000 room hours that I sell to the highest bidder anywhere in the world. And you can see

1680
03:05:42,000 --> 03:05:50,160
all of a sudden the yield, the rent, and the income of the property is dramatically increased.

1681
03:05:50,800 --> 03:05:56,080
I can also see the maintenance cost of the property falls. I get on Moore's law,

1682
03:05:56,800 --> 03:06:01,920
and I'm operating in cyberspace. So I got rid of Newton's laws. I got rid of all the friction and

1683
03:06:01,920 --> 03:06:09,520
all those problems. I tapped into the benefits of cyberspace. I created a global property.

1684
03:06:09,520 --> 03:06:15,600
I started monetizing it at different frequencies. And of course, now I can mortgage it to anybody

1685
03:06:15,600 --> 03:06:21,680
in the world. You're not going to be able to get a mortgage on a Turkish building from someone

1686
03:06:22,240 --> 03:06:27,360
in South Africa. You have to have to find someone that's local to the culture you're in.

1687
03:06:28,320 --> 03:06:34,880
So when you start to move from analog property to digital property, it's not just a little bit

1688
03:06:34,880 --> 03:06:42,000
better. It's a lot better. And what I just described, Lex, is the DeFi vision. It's the

1689
03:06:42,000 --> 03:06:52,160
beauty of DeFi flash loans, money moving at high velocity. At some point, if the hotel is

1690
03:06:52,160 --> 03:07:00,080
dematerialized, then what's the difference between renting a hotel room and loaning a block of stock?

1691
03:07:00,080 --> 03:07:05,440
Right? I'm just finding the highest best use of the thing. It feels like the magic really emerges

1692
03:07:05,440 --> 03:07:11,920
though when you build a lot, a market of layer two and layer three technologies on top of that.

1693
03:07:11,920 --> 03:07:18,560
It's like, maybe you can correct me if I'm wrong, but for all these hotels and all these kinds of

1694
03:07:18,560 --> 03:07:27,920
ideas, it's always touching humans at some point. And you know, consumers or humans, business

1695
03:07:27,920 --> 03:07:32,960
owners and so on. And so you have to create interface. You have to create services that

1696
03:07:32,960 --> 03:07:38,960
make all that super efficient, super fun to use, pleasant, effective, all those kinds of things.

1697
03:07:38,960 --> 03:07:41,440
And so you have to build in a whole economy on top of that.

1698
03:07:41,440 --> 03:07:46,000
Yeah. And I happen to think that won't be done by the crypto industry at all. I think that'll be

1699
03:07:46,000 --> 03:07:52,320
done by centralized applications. I think it'll be, you know, the citadels of the world, the high

1700
03:07:52,320 --> 03:08:00,800
speed traders of the world, the New Yorkers. I think it'll be Binance, FTX, and Coinbase as a

1701
03:08:00,800 --> 03:08:07,760
layer three exchange that will give you the yield and will give you the loan and the best terms.

1702
03:08:08,320 --> 03:08:13,920
Because ultimately you have to jump these compliance hoops. It comes like BlockFi can give

1703
03:08:13,920 --> 03:08:19,120
you yield, but they have to do it in a compliant way with the United States jurisdiction.

1704
03:08:19,120 --> 03:08:27,040
So ultimately, those applications to use that digital property and either generate a loan,

1705
03:08:27,040 --> 03:08:31,760
give you a loan on it, or give you yield on it are going to come from companies. But the difference,

1706
03:08:32,720 --> 03:08:39,200
the fundamental difference is it could be companies anywhere in the world. So if a company in

1707
03:08:39,200 --> 03:08:46,720
Singapore comes up with a better offering, right, then the capital is going to start to flow in

1708
03:08:46,720 --> 03:08:54,880
to Singapore. I can't send 10 city blocks of LA to Singapore to rent during a festival,

1709
03:08:54,880 --> 03:09:01,520
but I can send 10 blocks of Bitcoin to Singapore. So you've got a truly global market that's

1710
03:09:01,520 --> 03:09:07,840
functioning in this asset. And as a second order asset, for example, maybe you're an American

1711
03:09:07,840 --> 03:09:13,840
citizen and you own 10 Bitcoin and someone in Singapore will generate 27% yield in the Bitcoin,

1712
03:09:13,840 --> 03:09:19,520
but legally, you can't send the money to them or the Bitcoin to them. It doesn't matter, because

1713
03:09:19,520 --> 03:09:25,840
the fact that that exists means that someone in Hong Kong will borrow the 10 Bitcoin from somebody

1714
03:09:25,840 --> 03:09:31,680
in New York, and then they will put on the trade in Singapore. And that will create a demand for

1715
03:09:31,680 --> 03:09:37,600
Bitcoin, which will drive up the price of Bitcoin, which will result in an effective tax-free yield

1716
03:09:37,600 --> 03:09:42,400
for the person in the US that's not even in the jurisdiction. And that's going to create

1717
03:09:42,400 --> 03:09:48,800
a tax-free yield for the person in the jurisdiction. So there's nothing that's going on in Singapore

1718
03:09:48,800 --> 03:09:55,200
to drive up the price of your land in LA. But there is something going on everywhere in the

1719
03:09:55,200 --> 03:10:01,440
world to drive up the price of property in cyberspace if there's only one digital Manhattan.

1720
03:10:01,440 --> 03:10:09,280
And so there's a dynamic there, which is profound because it's global. But now let's go to the next

1721
03:10:09,280 --> 03:10:16,640
additional idea, which is let's just loan the money fast on a global network, and let's just

1722
03:10:16,640 --> 03:10:25,040
rent the hotel room fast in cyberspace. But let's move to maybe a more innovative idea.

1723
03:10:25,040 --> 03:10:31,040
The first generation of internet brought a lot of productivity, but there's also just a lot of

1724
03:10:31,040 --> 03:10:37,840
flaws in it. For example, Twitter is full of garbage. Instagram DMs are full of garbage. Your

1725
03:10:37,840 --> 03:10:43,440
YouTube is full of scams. Every 15 minutes, there's a Michael Saylor Bitcoin giveaway spun up on

1726
03:10:43,440 --> 03:10:51,600
YouTube. My Office 365 inbox is full of garbage, millions of spam messages. I'm running four

1727
03:10:51,600 --> 03:10:58,480
different email filters. My company spends million dollars a year to fight denial of service attacks

1728
03:10:58,480 --> 03:11:04,560
and all sorts of other security things. There are denial of service attacks everywhere against

1729
03:11:04,560 --> 03:11:10,240
everybody in cyberspace all the time. It's extreme. And we're all beset with hostility,

1730
03:11:10,240 --> 03:11:16,960
right? You've been a victim of it in Twitter. You go on Twitter and people post stuff they would

1731
03:11:16,960 --> 03:11:21,440
never say to your face. And then if you look, you find out that the account was created like

1732
03:11:21,440 --> 03:11:29,440
three days ago, and it's not even a real person. So we're beset with phishing attacks and scams

1733
03:11:29,440 --> 03:11:35,440
and spam bots and garbage. And why? And the answer is because the first generation of

1734
03:11:35,440 --> 03:11:40,640
internet was digital information, and there's no energy. There's no conservation of energy

1735
03:11:40,640 --> 03:11:48,240
in cyberspace. The thing that makes the universe work is conservation of energy. Like, if I went

1736
03:11:48,240 --> 03:11:55,680
to a hotel room, I'd have to post a credit card. And then if I smash the place up, there'd be

1737
03:11:55,680 --> 03:12:01,840
economic consequences. Maybe there'd be criminal consequences. There might be reputational

1738
03:12:01,840 --> 03:12:08,160
consequences. You know, a lamp might fall on me. But in the worst case, I can only smash up one

1739
03:12:08,160 --> 03:12:15,200
hotel room. Now, imagine I could actually write a Python script to send myself to every hotel room

1740
03:12:15,200 --> 03:12:23,280
in the world every minute, not post a credit card and smash them all up anonymously, right?

1741
03:12:23,280 --> 03:12:29,280
The thing that makes the universe work is friction, speed of sound, speed of light, and the

1742
03:12:29,280 --> 03:12:35,200
fact that ultimately it's conservative. You're either energy or you're matter. But once you've

1743
03:12:35,200 --> 03:12:42,720
used the energy, it's gone, and you can't do infinite everything. That's missing in cyberspace

1744
03:12:42,720 --> 03:12:49,600
right now. And if you look at all of the moral hazards and all of the product defects that we

1745
03:12:49,600 --> 03:12:57,360
have in all of these products, most of them, 99% of them, could be cured if we introduced

1746
03:12:58,560 --> 03:13:05,920
conservation of energy into cyberspace. And that's what you can do with high-speed digital

1747
03:13:05,920 --> 03:13:12,000
property, high-speed Bitcoin. And by high-speed, I mean not 20 transactions a day. I mean 20,000

1748
03:13:12,000 --> 03:13:22,560
transactions a day. So how do you do that? Well, I let everybody on Twitter post 1,000 or 10,000

1749
03:13:22,560 --> 03:13:30,000
Satoshis via lightning wallet, a lightning badge, give me an orange check. If you put up 20 bucks

1750
03:13:30,000 --> 03:13:38,080
once in your life, you could give 300 million people an orange check. Right now, you don't have

1751
03:13:38,080 --> 03:13:42,880
a blue check, Lex. You're a famous person. I don't know why you don't have a blue check. Have you

1752
03:13:42,880 --> 03:13:48,480
ever applied for a blue check? No. There are 360,000 people on Twitter with a blue check.

1753
03:13:48,480 --> 03:13:58,320
There are 300 million people on Twitter. So the conventional way to verify accounts is elitist,

1754
03:13:59,120 --> 03:14:04,400
archaic. Yeah, how does it work? How do you get a blue check? You got to apply and wait six months,

1755
03:14:04,400 --> 03:14:11,520
and you have to post three articles in the public mainstream media that illustrates you're a person

1756
03:14:11,520 --> 03:14:18,800
of interest. Interesting. Generally, they would grant them to CEOs of public companies. The whole

1757
03:14:18,800 --> 03:14:25,280
idea is to verify that you are who you say you are. But the question is, why isn't everybody

1758
03:14:25,280 --> 03:14:31,200
verified? And there's a couple of threads on that. One is, some people don't want to be doxxed.

1759
03:14:31,200 --> 03:14:36,480
They want to be anonymous. Sure. But there are even anonymous people that should be verified.

1760
03:14:36,480 --> 03:14:44,960
Right. Because otherwise, you're subjecting their entire following to phishing attacks and scams and

1761
03:14:44,960 --> 03:14:52,080
hostility. But the other- What's the orange verification? So this idea, can you actually

1762
03:14:52,080 --> 03:14:56,640
elaborate a little bit more if you put up 20 bucks? Yeah, I think everybody on Twitter ought to be

1763
03:14:56,640 --> 03:15:02,320
able to get an orange check if they could come up with like $10. And what is the power of that orange

1764
03:15:02,320 --> 03:15:08,400
check? What does that verify exactly? You basically post a security deposit for your

1765
03:15:08,400 --> 03:15:15,360
safe passage through cyberspace. So the way it would work is, if you've got $10 once in your life,

1766
03:15:16,160 --> 03:15:22,240
you can basically show that you're credit worthy. And that's your pledge to me that you're going to

1767
03:15:22,240 --> 03:15:29,520
act responsibly. So you put the 10 or the $20 into the lightning wallet, you get an orange check.

1768
03:15:30,240 --> 03:15:34,880
Then Twitter just gives you a setting where I can say, the only people that could DM me are orange

1769
03:15:34,880 --> 03:15:39,760
checks. The only people that can post on my tweets are orange checks. So instead of locking out the

1770
03:15:39,760 --> 03:15:47,120
public and just letting your followers comment, you lock out all the unverified. And that means

1771
03:15:47,120 --> 03:15:52,320
people that don't want to post $10 security deposit can't comment. Once you've done those

1772
03:15:52,320 --> 03:16:00,720
two things, then you're in position to monetize malice, monetize motion or malice for that matter.

1773
03:16:00,720 --> 03:16:09,280
But let's just say, for the sake of argument, you post something and 9700 bots spin up and pitch

1774
03:16:09,280 --> 03:16:17,280
their whatever scam. Right now, you sit and you go report, report, report, report, report, report,

1775
03:16:17,280 --> 03:16:22,880
and if you spend an hour, you get through half of them. You waste an hour of your life. They just

1776
03:16:22,880 --> 03:16:27,440
spend up another $97 because they've got a Python script spending it up, so it's hopeless.

1777
03:16:28,160 --> 03:16:34,160
But on the other hand, if you report them and they really are a bot, Twitter's got a method to

1778
03:16:34,160 --> 03:16:39,600
actually delete the account. They know that they're bots. The problem is not they don't know

1779
03:16:39,600 --> 03:16:43,280
how to delete the account. The problem is there are no consequences when they delete the account.

1780
03:16:43,920 --> 03:16:50,480
So if there are consequences, Twitter could give, they could just seize the $10 or seize the $20

1781
03:16:50,480 --> 03:16:56,880
because it's a bot. It's a malicious criminal act or whatever. It is a violation of the platform

1782
03:16:56,880 --> 03:17:03,360
rules. You end up seizing $10,000, give half the money to the reporter and half the money to the

1783
03:17:03,360 --> 03:17:09,200
Twitter platform, and- That's a really powerful idea, but that's tying it, that's adding friction

1784
03:17:09,920 --> 03:17:15,040
akin to the kind of friction you have in the physical world. You're tying, you have consequences.

1785
03:17:15,040 --> 03:17:19,360
You have real consequences. It's putting conservation of energy. Conservation of energy.

1786
03:17:19,360 --> 03:17:24,480
There's no friction. There's no nothing on this earth. Right? I mean, you can't walk out of this

1787
03:17:24,480 --> 03:17:30,640
earth, right? I mean, you can't walk across the room without friction, right? So friction is not

1788
03:17:30,640 --> 03:17:40,160
bad, right? Unnecessary friction is bad. So in this particular case, you're introducing

1789
03:17:40,160 --> 03:17:45,680
conservation of energy. And in essence, you're introducing the concept of consequence or truth

1790
03:17:45,680 --> 03:17:54,320
into cyberspace. And that means if you do want to spin up 10 million fake-less Freedmen's, right?

1791
03:17:54,320 --> 03:17:59,280
It's going to cost you a hundred million dollars to spin up 10 million fake Lexus.

1792
03:17:59,280 --> 03:18:06,320
But the thing is you could do that with the dollar, but you're saying that it's more tied

1793
03:18:06,320 --> 03:18:11,520
to physical reality when you do that with Bitcoin. Yeah. Well, let's follow up on that idea a bit

1794
03:18:11,520 --> 03:18:18,800
more. If you did do it with the dollar, then the question is how do 6 billion people deposit the

1795
03:18:18,800 --> 03:18:24,800
dollars, right? Because what you're doing is, yeah, could you do it with a credit card? Like,

1796
03:18:24,800 --> 03:18:32,640
how do you send dollars? You have to dox yourself. It's not easy. So you're talking about inputting

1797
03:18:32,640 --> 03:18:37,920
a credit card transaction, doxing yourself, and now you've just eliminated the 2 billion people

1798
03:18:37,920 --> 03:18:42,240
that don't have credit cards or don't have banks. You've also got a problem with everybody that

1799
03:18:42,240 --> 03:18:49,760
wants to remain anonymous. But you've also got this other problem, which is credit cards are

1800
03:18:49,760 --> 03:18:57,040
expensive transactions, low frequency, slow settlement. So do you really want to pay two and

1801
03:18:57,040 --> 03:19:04,560
a half percent every time you actually show a $20 deposit? And maybe you could do a Kluge version

1802
03:19:04,560 --> 03:19:13,200
of this for a subset of people. It's like it's 10% as good if you did it with conventional payment

1803
03:19:13,200 --> 03:19:23,200
rails. But what you can't do is the next idea, which is I want the orange badge to be used to

1804
03:19:23,200 --> 03:19:30,800
give me safe passage through cyberspace, tripping across every platform. So how do I solve the

1805
03:19:30,800 --> 03:19:37,200
denial of service attacks against a website? I publish a website. You hit it with a million

1806
03:19:37,200 --> 03:19:45,040
requests. OK, now how do I deal with that? Well, I can lock you out and I can make it a zero trust

1807
03:19:45,040 --> 03:19:50,960
website. And then you have to be coming at me through a trusted firewall with a trusted credential.

1808
03:19:50,960 --> 03:19:58,720
But that's a pretty draconian thing. Or I could put it behind a lightning wall. A lightning wall

1809
03:19:58,720 --> 03:20:05,760
would be, I just challenge you, Lex, you want to browse my website, you have to show me your

1810
03:20:05,760 --> 03:20:13,840
100,000 satoshis. Do you have 100,000 satoshis? Click. OK, now you click away a hundred times

1811
03:20:13,840 --> 03:20:18,880
or a thousand times. And after a thousand times, I'm like, well, now, Lex, you're getting offensive

1812
03:20:18,880 --> 03:20:23,920
over to take a satoshi from you or 10 satoshis, a microtransaction. You want to hit me a million

1813
03:20:23,920 --> 03:20:30,000
times? I'm taking all your satoshis and locking you out. What you want to do is you want to go

1814
03:20:30,000 --> 03:20:38,400
through 200 websites a day. And what you want every time you cross a domain, you need to be

1815
03:20:38,400 --> 03:20:44,160
able to, in a split second, prove that you've got some asset. And now when you cross back,

1816
03:20:44,160 --> 03:20:51,040
when you exit domain, you want to fetch your asset back. So how do I, in a friction-free fashion,

1817
03:20:51,040 --> 03:20:57,920
browse through dozens or hundreds of websites, post a security deposit for safe passage and then

1818
03:20:57,920 --> 03:21:05,920
get it back? You couldn't afford to pay a credit card fee each time. When you think about 2.5% as

1819
03:21:05,920 --> 03:21:14,080
a transaction fee, it means you trade the money 40 times and it's gone. It's gone.

1820
03:21:14,080 --> 03:21:18,160
Yeah. So you can't do this kind of hopping around through the internet with this kind of

1821
03:21:18,160 --> 03:21:22,880
verification that grounds you to a physical reality. It's a really, really interesting idea.

1822
03:21:22,880 --> 03:21:24,720
Why hasn't that been done?

1823
03:21:25,920 --> 03:21:31,920
I think you need two things. You need an idea like a digital asset, like Bitcoin,

1824
03:21:31,920 --> 03:21:37,840
that's a bearer instrument for final settlement. And then you need a high-speed transaction network

1825
03:21:37,840 --> 03:21:45,920
like Lightning, where the transaction cost might be a 20th of a penny or less. And if you roll the

1826
03:21:45,920 --> 03:21:54,160
clock back 24 months, I don't think you had the Lightning network in a stable point. It's really

1827
03:21:54,160 --> 03:22:00,960
just the past 12 months. It's an idea you could think about this year. And I think you need to

1828
03:22:02,720 --> 03:22:09,280
be aware of Bitcoin as something other than like a scary speculative asset. So I really think we're

1829
03:22:09,280 --> 03:22:10,320
just the beginning.

1830
03:22:10,320 --> 03:22:16,880
The embryonic stage. I have to ask Michael Saylor, you said before, there's no second best to Bitcoin.

1831
03:22:18,320 --> 03:22:22,800
What would be the second best? Traditionally, there's Ethereum with smart contracts, Cardano

1832
03:22:22,800 --> 03:22:31,440
with proof of stake, Polkadot with interoperability between blockchains. Dogecoin has the incredible

1833
03:22:31,440 --> 03:22:38,320
power of the meme. Privacy with Monero, I just can keep going. There's the

1834
03:22:38,320 --> 03:22:46,160
there's, of course, after the block size wars, the different offshoots of Bitcoin.

1835
03:22:46,160 --> 03:22:53,120
I think if you decompose or segment the crypto market, you've got crypto property. Bitcoin is

1836
03:22:53,120 --> 03:22:59,440
the king of that. And other Bitcoin forks that wanted to be a bearer instrument store of value

1837
03:23:00,400 --> 03:23:06,160
would be a property, a Bitcoin cash or Litecoin, something like that. Then you've got crypto

1838
03:23:06,160 --> 03:23:12,240
currencies. I don't think I don't think Bitcoin's a currency because a currency I define in nation

1839
03:23:12,240 --> 03:23:19,680
states since a currency is a digital asset that you can transfer as a, you know, in a transaction

1840
03:23:19,680 --> 03:23:26,000
without incurring a taxable obligation. So that means has to be a stable dollar or a stable euro

1841
03:23:26,000 --> 03:23:31,360
or a stable yen, a stable coin. So I think that crypto currencies, Tether, Circle, most famous.

1842
03:23:31,360 --> 03:23:36,240
Then you've got crypto platforms, you know, and Ethereum is the most famous of the crypto platforms,

1843
03:23:36,240 --> 03:23:42,640
the platform upon which, you know, with smart contract functionality, etc. And then I think

1844
03:23:42,640 --> 03:23:48,480
you've got just crypto securities. It's just like my favorite whatever meme coin. And I love it

1845
03:23:48,480 --> 03:23:52,960
because I love it. And it's attached to my game or my company or my persona or my whatever.

1846
03:23:53,600 --> 03:23:59,120
I think if you if you, you know, push me and said, what's the second most popular

1847
03:23:59,120 --> 03:24:04,000
push me and said, what's the second best? I would say the world wants two things.

1848
03:24:04,000 --> 03:24:10,080
It wants crypto property as a savings account and it wants cryptocurrency as a checking account.

1849
03:24:10,080 --> 03:24:16,240
And that means that the that the most popular thing really is going to be a stable coin dollar.

1850
03:24:17,120 --> 03:24:24,560
Right. And there's a maybe a fight right now. It might be Tether. Right. But a stable dollar,

1851
03:24:24,560 --> 03:24:30,400
because I feel like the market opportunity, it's not clear that there'll be one that will win.

1852
03:24:30,400 --> 03:24:35,280
The class of stable dollars is probably a one to ten trillion dollar market easily.

1853
03:24:37,040 --> 03:24:41,760
I think that in a crypto platform space, Ethereum will compete with Solana and

1854
03:24:41,760 --> 03:24:44,400
Binance Smart Chain and the like.

1855
03:24:44,400 --> 03:24:47,600
Are there certain characteristics of any of them that kind of stand out to you?

1856
03:24:49,920 --> 03:24:52,400
Don't you think the competition is based on a set of features?

1857
03:24:52,400 --> 03:24:57,360
There's also so the set of features that that cryptocurrency provides,

1858
03:24:57,360 --> 03:25:01,680
but also the community that it provides. So do you think the community matters and sort

1859
03:25:01,680 --> 03:25:05,840
of the adoption, the dynamic of the adoption, both across the developers and the investors?

1860
03:25:05,840 --> 03:25:12,080
If I'm looking at them, I mean, the first question is, is what's the regulatory risk?

1861
03:25:12,080 --> 03:25:16,480
How likely is it to be deemed a property versus security? And the second is,

1862
03:25:17,360 --> 03:25:21,440
is what's the competitive risk? And the third is what's the speed and the performance and

1863
03:25:21,440 --> 03:25:28,080
the, you know, all those things, you know, lead to the question of what's the security risk?

1864
03:25:28,080 --> 03:25:34,640
How likely is it to crash and burn and how stable or unstable is it? And then there's the

1865
03:25:35,680 --> 03:25:40,720
marketing risk. I mean, there are different teams behind each of these things and communities behind

1866
03:25:40,720 --> 03:25:50,080
them. I think that the big cloud looming over the crypto industry is regulatory treatment of

1867
03:25:50,080 --> 03:25:54,640
cryptocurrencies and regulatory treatment of crypto securities and crypto platforms.

1868
03:25:54,640 --> 03:25:58,400
And I think that won't be determined until the end of the first Biden administration.

1869
03:25:58,400 --> 03:26:05,680
For example, there are people that would like only US FDIC insured banks to issue

1870
03:26:05,680 --> 03:26:10,560
cryptocurrencies. They want JP Morgan to issue a crypto dollar backed one to one.

1871
03:26:11,440 --> 03:26:16,000
But then in the US right now, we have Circle and we have other companies that are licensed

1872
03:26:16,000 --> 03:26:21,440
entities that are backed by cash and cash equivalents, but they're not FDIC insured banks.

1873
03:26:22,160 --> 03:26:26,480
There's also a debate in Congress about whether state chartered banks should be able to issue

1874
03:26:26,480 --> 03:26:33,440
these things. And then we have Tether and others that are outside of the US jurisdiction.

1875
03:26:34,480 --> 03:26:38,160
They're probably not backed by cash and cash equivalents. They're backed by stuff

1876
03:26:38,160 --> 03:26:44,720
and we don't know what stuff. And then finally you have, you know, UST and DAI, which are

1877
03:26:44,720 --> 03:26:52,000
algorithmic stable coins that are even more innovative further outside the compliance

1878
03:26:52,000 --> 03:26:57,840
framework. So if you ask who's going to win, the question is really, I don't know, will the market

1879
03:26:57,840 --> 03:27:02,800
decide or will the regulators decide? If the regulators get out of the way and the market

1880
03:27:02,800 --> 03:27:09,040
fall out, well then it's an interesting discussion. And then I think that all bets are off if the

1881
03:27:09,040 --> 03:27:13,200
regulators get more heavy handed with this. And I think you could have the same discussion with

1882
03:27:13,200 --> 03:27:19,680
crypto properties. Like the DeFi exchanges and the crypto exchanges, the SEC would like to regulate

1883
03:27:19,680 --> 03:27:24,160
the crypto exchanges. They'd like to regulate the DeFi exchanges. That means they may regulate the

1884
03:27:24,160 --> 03:27:31,520
crypto platforms and at what rate and in what fashion. And so I think that I could give you

1885
03:27:31,520 --> 03:27:39,680
an opinion if it was limited to competition and the current regulatory regime, but I think that

1886
03:27:39,680 --> 03:27:50,000
the regulations are so fast moving and it's so uncertain that it's, you can't make a decision

1887
03:27:51,200 --> 03:27:55,680
without considering the potential actions of the regulators.

1888
03:27:55,680 --> 03:27:59,840
I hope the regulators get out of the way. Can you steal me on the case

1889
03:27:59,840 --> 03:28:05,040
that Dogecoin is I guess the second best cryptocurrency if you don't consider Bitcoin

1890
03:28:05,040 --> 03:28:11,520
a cryptocurrency, but instead a crypto property. I would classify it as crypto property because

1891
03:28:11,520 --> 03:28:18,400
the US dollar is a currency. So unless your crypto asset is pegged algorithmically or stably to the

1892
03:28:18,400 --> 03:28:22,080
value of the dollar is not a currency, it's a property or it's an asset.

1893
03:28:22,880 --> 03:28:28,480
So then can you steal me on the case that Dogecoin is the best cryptocurrency then?

1894
03:28:29,440 --> 03:28:31,840
Because Bitcoin is not even in that list.

1895
03:28:31,840 --> 03:28:36,320
The debate is going to be whether it's property or security. And there's a debate whether it's

1896
03:28:36,320 --> 03:28:44,000
decentralized enough. So let's assume it was decentralized. Well, it's increasing at not quite

1897
03:28:44,000 --> 03:28:50,560
five, what, 5% a year inflation rate, but it's not 5% exponentially. It's like a plus 5 million,

1898
03:28:52,080 --> 03:28:59,200
5% something captain is less. I forget the exact number, but it's an inflationary property. It's

1899
03:28:59,200 --> 03:29:06,960
got a lower inflation rate than the US dollar. And it's got a much lower inflation rate than

1900
03:29:07,520 --> 03:29:11,680
than many other fiat currencies. So I think you could say that.

1901
03:29:11,680 --> 03:29:17,040
But don't you see the power of meme, the power of ideas, the power of

1902
03:29:18,640 --> 03:29:25,280
fun or whatever mechanism is used to captivate a community?

1903
03:29:25,280 --> 03:29:30,800
I do, but there are meme stocks. It doesn't absolve you of your ethical and securities

1904
03:29:30,800 --> 03:29:37,760
liabilities if you're promoting it. So I don't have a problem with people buying a stock.

1905
03:29:40,960 --> 03:29:45,520
The way I divide the world is there's investment, there's saving,

1906
03:29:46,080 --> 03:29:53,840
and there's speculation and there's trading. So Bitcoin is an asset for saving. If you want to

1907
03:29:53,840 --> 03:30:01,040
save money for 100 years, you don't really want to take on execution risk or the like. So you're

1908
03:30:01,040 --> 03:30:06,880
just buying something to hold forever. For you to actually endorse something as a property,

1909
03:30:07,520 --> 03:30:11,600
like if you said to me, Mike, what should I buy for the next 100 years? I say, well,

1910
03:30:11,600 --> 03:30:16,800
some amount of real estate, some amount of scarce collectibles, some amount of Bitcoin,

1911
03:30:16,800 --> 03:30:21,680
right? You can run your company, right? But running your company is an investment.

1912
03:30:21,680 --> 03:30:26,080
So the savings are properties. If you said, what should I invest in? I'd say, well,

1913
03:30:26,080 --> 03:30:30,160
here's a list of good companies, private companies, you can start your own company,

1914
03:30:30,160 --> 03:30:37,440
that's an investment, right? If you said, what should I trade? Well, I'm trading as like a

1915
03:30:37,440 --> 03:30:43,600
proprietary thing. I don't have any special insight into that. If you're a good trader,

1916
03:30:43,600 --> 03:30:49,200
you know you are. If you said to me, what should you speculate in? We talk about meme stocks

1917
03:30:49,200 --> 03:30:56,880
and meme coins and it's kind of sits up there. It sits right in the same space with what horse

1918
03:30:56,880 --> 03:31:01,840
should you bet on and what sports team should you gamble on and should you bet on black six

1919
03:31:01,840 --> 03:31:08,240
times in a row and double down each time. I mean, it's fun, but at the end of the day,

1920
03:31:09,920 --> 03:31:17,280
it's a speculation, right? You can't build a civilization on it. It's not an institutional

1921
03:31:17,280 --> 03:31:24,000
asset. And in fact, where I'd leave it, right, is Bitcoin is clearly digital, which makes it

1922
03:31:24,000 --> 03:31:30,000
an institutional grade investable asset for a public company, a public figure, a public investor,

1923
03:31:30,000 --> 03:31:37,920
or anybody that's risk adverse. I think that the top 100 other cryptos are like

1924
03:31:37,920 --> 03:31:43,120
venture capital investments. And if you're a VC and if you're a qualified technical investor and

1925
03:31:43,120 --> 03:31:48,400
you have a pool of capital and you can take that kind of risk, then you can parse through that and

1926
03:31:48,400 --> 03:31:55,040
form opinions. It's just orders of magnitude more risky because of competition, because of ambition,

1927
03:31:55,040 --> 03:32:00,800
and because of regulation. And if you take the meme coins, it's like, you know,

1928
03:32:00,800 --> 03:32:06,800
when some rapper comes out with a meme coin, it's like, maybe it'll peak when I hear about it,

1929
03:32:06,800 --> 03:32:14,640
right? I mean, SHIB was created as a coin such that it had so many zeros after the decimal point

1930
03:32:14,640 --> 03:32:22,400
that when you looked at it on the exchanges, it always showed 0000. And it wasn't until like six

1931
03:32:22,400 --> 03:32:26,800
months after it got popular that they started expanding the display so you could see whether

1932
03:32:26,800 --> 03:32:32,880
the price had changed. That's speculation. You've been, maybe you can correct me, but you've been

1933
03:32:32,880 --> 03:32:39,120
critical of Elon Musk in the past in the crypto space. Where do you stand on Elon's effect on

1934
03:32:39,120 --> 03:32:45,840
Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general these days? I believe that Bitcoin is a massive breakthrough

1935
03:32:45,840 --> 03:32:50,720
for the human race that will cure half the problems in the world and generate hundreds

1936
03:32:50,720 --> 03:32:58,880
of trillions of dollars of economic value to the civilization. And I believe that it's in an early

1937
03:32:58,880 --> 03:33:04,080
stage where many people don't understand it, and they're afraid of it, and there's FUD,

1938
03:33:04,800 --> 03:33:10,480
and there's uncertainty, there's doubt, and there's fear. And it's a very noisy crypto world,

1939
03:33:10,480 --> 03:33:18,000
and there's 15,000 other cryptos that are seeking relevance. And I think most of the FUD

1940
03:33:19,360 --> 03:33:24,720
is actually fueled by the other crypto entrepreneurs. So the environmental FUD

1941
03:33:24,720 --> 03:33:31,040
and the other types of uncertainty that surround Bitcoin, generally they're not coming from

1942
03:33:31,040 --> 03:33:37,520
legitimate environmentalists. They don't come from legitimate critics. They actually are guerrilla

1943
03:33:37,520 --> 03:33:44,720
marketing campaigns that are being financed and fueled by other crypto entrepreneurs

1944
03:33:45,920 --> 03:33:52,400
because they have an interest in doing so. So if I look at the constructive path forward,

1945
03:33:52,400 --> 03:33:59,520
first, I think it'd be very constructive for corporations to embrace Bitcoin and build

1946
03:33:59,520 --> 03:34:06,320
applications on top of it. You don't need to fix it. There's nothing wrong with it, right? Like

1947
03:34:06,320 --> 03:34:10,880
when you put it on a layer two and a layer three, it moves a billion times a second at the speed

1948
03:34:10,880 --> 03:34:18,320
of light. So every beautiful, cool DeFi application, every crypto application,

1949
03:34:18,320 --> 03:34:24,960
everything you could imagine you might want to do, you can do with a legitimate company

1950
03:34:25,600 --> 03:34:32,960
and a legitimate website or mobile application sitting on top of Bitcoin or Lightning,

1951
03:34:33,520 --> 03:34:39,920
if you want to. So I think that to the extent that people do that, that's going to be better

1952
03:34:39,920 --> 03:34:45,920
for the world. If you consider what holds people back, I think it's just misperceptions

1953
03:34:45,920 --> 03:34:53,840
about what Bitcoin is. So I'm a big fan of just educating people. If you're not going to

1954
03:34:53,840 --> 03:35:00,000
commercialize it, then just educate people on what it is. So for example, Bitcoin is the most

1955
03:35:00,000 --> 03:35:06,800
efficient use of energy in the world by far, right? Most people don't, they don't necessarily

1956
03:35:06,800 --> 03:35:11,280
perceive that or realize that. But if you were to take any metric, energy intensity,

1957
03:35:11,280 --> 03:35:18,720
you put like $2 billion worth of electricity in the network every year and it's worth $850 billion.

1958
03:35:19,280 --> 03:35:26,320
There is no industry in the real world, right, that is that energy efficient. Not only that

1959
03:35:26,320 --> 03:35:33,440
energy efficient, it's also the most sustainable industry. We do surveys, 58% of Bitcoin mining

1960
03:35:33,440 --> 03:35:42,880
energy is sustainable. So there's a very good story. In fact, every other industry, planes,

1961
03:35:42,880 --> 03:35:50,880
trains, automobiles, construction, food, medicine, everything else is less clean, less efficient.

1962
03:35:52,000 --> 03:35:54,880
So the basic debate was-

1963
03:35:54,880 --> 03:35:59,520
I wouldn't say there is a debate. I would just say that to the extent that the Bitcoin community

1964
03:35:59,520 --> 03:36:08,400
with Elon, it was just this environmental uncertainty that he fueled in a couple of his

1965
03:36:08,400 --> 03:36:14,240
tweets, right? Which I think just is very distracting. Well, that was one of them.

1966
03:36:14,240 --> 03:36:18,880
But I think it's like the Bitcoin maximalists, but generally the crypto community, what you call

1967
03:36:18,880 --> 03:36:28,160
the crypto entrepreneurs are, it's also they're using it for, I mean, for investment, for

1968
03:36:28,160 --> 03:36:36,240
speculation, and therefore get very passionate about people's kind of celebrities, including you,

1969
03:36:36,240 --> 03:36:47,280
like famous people, saying positive stuff about any one particular crypto thing you can buy in

1970
03:36:47,280 --> 03:36:54,400
Coinbase. And so they might be unhappy with Elon Musk that he's promoting Bitcoin and then not,

1971
03:36:54,400 --> 03:37:03,760
and then promoting Dogecoin, then not. There's so much emotion tied up in the communication

1972
03:37:03,760 --> 03:37:07,840
on this topic. And I think that's where a lot of the-

1973
03:37:08,480 --> 03:37:14,880
Look, I don't have a criticism of Elon Musk. He's free to do whatever he wishes to do. In fact,

1974
03:37:15,440 --> 03:37:22,400
Elon Musk is the second largest supporter of Bitcoin in the world. So I think that the Bitcoin

1975
03:37:22,400 --> 03:37:30,080
community tends to eat its own quite a bit. It tends to be very, very self-critical. And instead

1976
03:37:30,080 --> 03:37:38,000
of saying, well, Elon is more supportive of Bitcoin than the other 10,000 people in the world,

1977
03:37:38,880 --> 03:37:41,440
with serious amounts of money, they focus upon-

1978
03:37:42,800 --> 03:37:46,000
Yeah, this is strange. Eating your own is just-

1979
03:37:46,000 --> 03:37:50,480
That's right. I mean, I think he's free to do what he wants to do. And I think he's done a lot

1980
03:37:50,480 --> 03:37:56,800
of good for Bitcoin in putting it on the balance sheet of Tesla and holding it. And I think that

1981
03:37:56,800 --> 03:38:04,320
sent a very powerful message. Do you have advice for young people? So you've had a heck of a life.

1982
03:38:05,680 --> 03:38:12,560
You've done quite a lot of things before MIT, but starting with MIT. Is there advice here for

1983
03:38:12,560 --> 03:38:21,120
young people in high school and college, how to have a career they can be proud of,

1984
03:38:21,120 --> 03:38:27,440
how to have a life they can be proud of? I was asked by somebody for quick advice

1985
03:38:28,640 --> 03:38:35,600
for his young children. He had twins when they enter adulthood. He said, give me your advice

1986
03:38:35,600 --> 03:38:44,800
for them in a letter. I'm going to give it to them when they turn 21 or something. I was at a party,

1987
03:38:44,800 --> 03:38:47,760
and then he handed me this sheet of paper. I thought, oh, he wants me to write it down right

1988
03:38:47,760 --> 03:38:51,840
now. So I sat down, I started writing, and I figured, well, what would you want to tell someone

1989
03:38:51,840 --> 03:38:55,040
at age 21? You wrote it down.

1990
03:38:55,040 --> 03:38:58,480
So I wrote it down. And then I tweeted it, and it's sitting on Twitter, but I tell you what I

1991
03:38:58,480 --> 03:39:06,400
said. I said, my advice if you're entering adulthood, focus your energy, guard your time,

1992
03:39:08,160 --> 03:39:17,520
train your mind, train your body, think for yourself, curate your friends,

1993
03:39:17,520 --> 03:39:28,080
curate your environment, keep your promises, stay cheerful and constructive, and upgrade the world.

1994
03:39:29,120 --> 03:39:30,160
Like that was the 10.

1995
03:39:30,160 --> 03:39:37,680
Upgrade the world. That's an interesting choice of words. Upgrade the world. Upgrade the world.

1996
03:39:37,680 --> 03:39:39,200
It's like an engineering training.

1997
03:39:39,200 --> 03:39:43,040
Focus your energy. It's a very, yeah, it's a very engineering-themed,

1998
03:39:43,040 --> 03:39:50,560
very engineering-themed, keep your promises too. That's an interesting one.

1999
03:39:50,560 --> 03:39:57,520
I think most people suffer because they just, they don't focus. You got to figure out,

2000
03:39:57,520 --> 03:40:00,960
I think the big risk in this world is there's too much of everything.

2001
03:40:00,960 --> 03:40:01,200
Yeah.

2002
03:40:01,840 --> 03:40:06,720
Like you can sit and watch chess videos a hundred hours a week, and you'll never get

2003
03:40:06,720 --> 03:40:14,720
through all the chess videos. There's too much of every possible thing, too much of every good thing.

2004
03:40:14,720 --> 03:40:22,000
So figuring out what you want to do and then everything will suck up your time. There's

2005
03:40:22,000 --> 03:40:26,480
a hundred streaming channels to binge watch on. So you got to guard your time and then

2006
03:40:27,600 --> 03:40:34,800
train your body, train your mind, and control who's around you, control what surrounds you.

2007
03:40:34,800 --> 03:40:41,600
So ultimately in a world where there's too much of everything, then you're successful.

2008
03:40:41,600 --> 03:40:45,360
It's like those laser eyes. It's like those laser eyes. You have to focus

2009
03:40:47,600 --> 03:40:49,440
on just a few of those things.

2010
03:40:50,160 --> 03:40:55,200
Yeah. I mean, I got a thousand opinions we could talk about and I could pursue a thousand things,

2011
03:40:55,200 --> 03:41:02,880
but I don't expect to be successful. And I'm not sure that my opinion in any of the 999 is any more

2012
03:41:02,880 --> 03:41:11,520
valid than the leader of thought in that area. So how about if I just focus upon one thing

2013
03:41:12,480 --> 03:41:18,480
and then deliver the best I can in the one thing. That's the laser eye message.

2014
03:41:19,440 --> 03:41:21,040
The rest get you distracted.

2015
03:41:21,040 --> 03:41:24,000
Well, how do you achieve that? Do you find yourself,

2016
03:41:24,000 --> 03:41:30,160
given the way you are in life, having to say no a lot, or just focus comes

2017
03:41:30,160 --> 03:41:34,400
naturally when you just ignore everything around you? So how do you achieve that focus?

2018
03:41:35,600 --> 03:41:37,920
I think it helps if people know what you're focused on.

2019
03:41:39,120 --> 03:41:43,360
So everything about you just radiates that people know. People know this is-

2020
03:41:43,360 --> 03:41:49,200
If they know what you're focused on, then you won't get so many other things coming your way.

2021
03:41:49,200 --> 03:41:58,160
If you, you know, if you dolly or if you flirt with 27 different things,

2022
03:41:58,160 --> 03:42:02,800
then you're going to get approached by people in each of the 27 communities, right?

2023
03:42:03,760 --> 03:42:11,360
You mentioned getting a PhD and giving your roots at MIT. Do you think there's all kinds of

2024
03:42:12,080 --> 03:42:18,400
journeys you can take to educate yourself? Do you think a PhD or school is still worth it?

2025
03:42:20,160 --> 03:42:23,360
Or is there other paths through life that-

2026
03:42:23,360 --> 03:42:26,640
Is it worth it if you have to pay for it? Is it worth it if you spend the time on it?

2027
03:42:26,640 --> 03:42:30,960
Yeah. The time and the money is a big cost.

2028
03:42:30,960 --> 03:42:31,680
I think-

2029
03:42:32,960 --> 03:42:34,720
Time probably the bigger one, right?

2030
03:42:34,720 --> 03:42:43,360
It seems clear to me that the world wants more specialists. It wants you to be an expert

2031
03:42:43,360 --> 03:42:53,360
and to focus on one area. And it's punishing generalists, jack of all trades, especially

2032
03:42:53,360 --> 03:42:57,520
people that are generalists in the physical realm. Because if you're a specialist in the digital

2033
03:42:57,520 --> 03:43:04,000
realm, you might very well- You're the person with 700,000 followers on Twitter and you show

2034
03:43:04,000 --> 03:43:10,400
them how to tie knots. Or, you know, you're the banjo player, you know, with 1.8 million followers.

2035
03:43:10,400 --> 03:43:19,200
And when everybody types banjo, it's you, right? And so the world wants people that do something

2036
03:43:19,200 --> 03:43:28,000
well. And then it wants to stamp out 18 million copies of them. And so that argues in favor of

2037
03:43:28,000 --> 03:43:33,760
focus. Now, I mean, the definition of a PhD is someone with enough of an education that they're

2038
03:43:33,760 --> 03:43:40,720
capable of or have made. I guess to get a PhD, technically, you have to have done a dissertation

2039
03:43:40,720 --> 03:43:46,800
where you made a seminal contribution to the body of human knowledge, right? And if you haven't done

2040
03:43:46,800 --> 03:43:52,800
that, technically, you know, you have a master's degree, but you're not a doctor. So if you're

2041
03:43:52,800 --> 03:43:59,920
interested in any of the academic disciplines that a PhD would be granted for, then I can see

2042
03:43:59,920 --> 03:44:06,400
that being a reasonable pursuit. But there are many people that are specialists. You know,

2043
03:44:06,400 --> 03:44:15,760
the agitator? Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's the world's greatest chess commentator. And I've watched his

2044
03:44:15,760 --> 03:44:19,840
career, and he's got progressively better, and he's really good. He's gonna love hearing this.

2045
03:44:20,640 --> 03:44:25,760
Yeah, if the agitator hears this, I'm a big fan of the agitator. I have to cut myself off,

2046
03:44:25,760 --> 03:44:32,160
right? Because otherwise you'll watch the entire Paul Morphy saga for your weekend. But the point

2047
03:44:32,160 --> 03:44:39,040
really is YouTube is full of experts who are specialists in something. And they rise to the

2048
03:44:39,040 --> 03:44:49,040
top of their profession, and Twitter is too, and the internet is. So I would advocate that you

2049
03:44:49,040 --> 03:44:56,320
figure out what you're passionate about, and what you're good at, and you do focus on it.

2050
03:44:57,280 --> 03:45:05,520
Especially if the thing that you're doing can be automated. The problem is, you know, back to that

2051
03:45:05,520 --> 03:45:13,200
500,000 algebra teacher type comment. The problem is, if it is possible to be automated, then over

2052
03:45:13,200 --> 03:45:22,640
time, someone's probably gonna automate it. And that squeezes the state space of everybody else.

2053
03:45:22,640 --> 03:45:29,600
It's like after the lockdowns, it used to be there are all these local bands that played in bars,

2054
03:45:29,600 --> 03:45:33,920
and everybody went to the bar to see the local band. And then during the lockdown, you would

2055
03:45:33,920 --> 03:45:40,800
have like these six super groups, and they would all get 500,000 or a million followers. And all

2056
03:45:40,800 --> 03:45:49,840
these smaller local bands just got no attention at all. Well, the interesting thing is one of those

2057
03:45:49,840 --> 03:45:55,760
500,000 algebra teachers is likely to be part of the automation. So it's like, it's an opportunity

2058
03:45:55,760 --> 03:46:04,400
for you to think, where's my field, my discipline evolving into? I talked to a bunch of librarians,

2059
03:46:04,400 --> 03:46:10,560
just happened to be friends with librarians. And that's, libraries will probably be evolving,

2060
03:46:10,560 --> 03:46:17,360
and it's up to you as a librarian to be one of the few that remain in the rubble.

2061
03:46:18,000 --> 03:46:22,400
If you're going to give commentary on Shakespeare plays, I want you to basically do it for every

2062
03:46:22,400 --> 03:46:28,240
Shakespeare play. Like I want you to be the Shakespeare dude, because once, just like Lex,

2063
03:46:28,240 --> 03:46:31,360
you're like... I don't know what kind of...

2064
03:46:31,360 --> 03:46:39,680
You're the deep thinking podcaster, right? You're the podcaster that goes after the deep

2065
03:46:39,680 --> 03:46:46,480
intellectual conversations. And once I get comfortable with you, and I like you,

2066
03:46:46,480 --> 03:46:54,640
then I start binge watching Lex. But if you changed your format through 16 different formats,

2067
03:46:54,640 --> 03:47:00,320
so that you could compete with 16 different other personalities on YouTube, you probably wouldn't

2068
03:47:00,320 --> 03:47:05,360
beat any of them, right? You would probably just kind of sink into the... You're the number two

2069
03:47:05,360 --> 03:47:12,800
or number three guy. You're not the number one guy in the format. And I think that the algorithm,

2070
03:47:12,800 --> 03:47:18,320
the Twitter algorithm and the YouTube algorithm, they really reward the person that's focused

2071
03:47:18,320 --> 03:47:25,520
on message, consistent. The world wants somebody they can trust that's consistent and reliable,

2072
03:47:25,520 --> 03:47:31,440
and they kind of want to know what they're getting into, because... And this is taken for granted

2073
03:47:31,440 --> 03:47:39,760
maybe, but there's 10 million people vying for every hour of your time. And so the fact that

2074
03:47:39,760 --> 03:47:45,280
anybody gives you any time at all is a huge privilege, right? And you should be thanking

2075
03:47:45,280 --> 03:47:51,760
them and you should respect their time. It's interesting. Everything you said is very interesting.

2076
03:47:51,760 --> 03:47:56,960
But of course, from my perspective, and probably from your perspective, my actual life has nothing

2077
03:47:56,960 --> 03:48:04,640
to do with... It's just being focused on stuff. And in my case, it's like focus on doing the thing I

2078
03:48:04,640 --> 03:48:10,160
really enjoy doing, and being myself, and not caring about anything else. I don't care about

2079
03:48:10,160 --> 03:48:16,800
views or likes or attention. And just maintaining that focus is the way, from an individual

2080
03:48:16,800 --> 03:48:24,400
perspective, you live that life. But yeah, it does seem that the world and technology is rewarding

2081
03:48:24,400 --> 03:48:30,320
the specialization and creating bigger and bigger platforms for the different specializations. And

2082
03:48:30,320 --> 03:48:34,800
that lifts all boats, actually, because the specializations get better and better and better

2083
03:48:34,800 --> 03:48:40,080
at teaching people to do specific things, and they educate themselves, and it's just... Everybody

2084
03:48:40,080 --> 03:48:45,600
gets more and more knowledgeable and more and more empowered. The reward for authenticity

2085
03:48:45,600 --> 03:48:53,680
more than offsets the specificity with which you pursue your mission. Another way to say it is,

2086
03:48:53,680 --> 03:49:02,960
like, nobody wants to read advertising. If you were to spend a hundred million dollars advertising

2087
03:49:02,960 --> 03:49:12,720
your thing, I probably wouldn't want to watch it. We see the death of that. And so the commercial

2088
03:49:12,720 --> 03:49:20,080
shows are losing their audiences, and the authentic specialists or the authentic artists

2089
03:49:20,080 --> 03:49:27,600
are gaining their audience. And that's a beautiful thing. Speaking of deep thinking,

2090
03:49:29,280 --> 03:49:36,560
you're just a human. Your life ends. You've accumulated so much wisdom, so much money,

2091
03:49:37,200 --> 03:49:43,760
but the ride ends. Do you think about that? Do you ponder your death, your mortality? Are you

2092
03:49:43,760 --> 03:49:52,160
afraid of it? When I go, all my assets will flow into a foundation, and the foundation's mission

2093
03:49:52,160 --> 03:50:00,880
is to make education free for everybody forever. And if I'm able to contribute to the creation of

2094
03:50:02,720 --> 03:50:08,080
a more perfect monetary system, then maybe that foundation will go on forever.

2095
03:50:08,080 --> 03:50:16,240
Right. The idea, the foundation of the idea. Each of the foundations.

2096
03:50:16,960 --> 03:50:21,280
It's not clear we're on the S-curve of immortal life yet. That's a biological

2097
03:50:21,280 --> 03:50:27,200
question, and you ask that on some of your other interviews a lot. I think that we are on the

2098
03:50:27,200 --> 03:50:36,000
threshold of immortal life for ideas, or immortal life for certain institutions

2099
03:50:36,000 --> 03:50:43,200
or computer programs. So if we can fix the money, then you can create a technically perfected

2100
03:50:43,200 --> 03:50:50,000
endowment. And then the question really is, what are your ideas? What do you want to leave behind?

2101
03:50:50,000 --> 03:50:56,000
And so if it's a park, then you endow the park, right? If it's free education, you endow that.

2102
03:50:56,000 --> 03:51:01,200
If it's some other ethical idea, right?

2103
03:51:01,200 --> 03:51:10,160
Does it make you sad that there's something that you've endowed, some very powerful idea

2104
03:51:11,040 --> 03:51:16,480
of digital energy that you put out into the world, you help put it into the world,

2105
03:51:17,360 --> 03:51:26,560
and your mind, your conscious mind will no longer be there to experience it. It's just gone forever.

2106
03:51:26,560 --> 03:51:32,320
SFX I rather think that the thing that Satoshi taught us is,

2107
03:51:32,320 --> 03:51:37,120
you should do your part during some phase of the journey, and then you should get out of the way.

2108
03:51:39,760 --> 03:51:46,800
I think Steve Jobs said something similar to that effect in a very famous speech one day,

2109
03:51:46,800 --> 03:51:51,920
which is, death is a natural part of life, and it makes way for the next generation.

2110
03:51:51,920 --> 03:51:57,520
And I think the goal is, you upgrade the world, right? You leave it a better place,

2111
03:51:57,520 --> 03:52:07,680
but you get out of the way. And I think when that breaks down, you know, bad things happen.

2112
03:52:08,880 --> 03:52:12,080
I think nature cleanses itself. There's a cycle of life.

2113
03:52:13,440 --> 03:52:18,640
And speaking of one of great people who did also get out of the way is George Washington. So

2114
03:52:18,640 --> 03:52:25,360
hopefully, when you get out of the way, nobody's bleeding you to death in hope of helping you.

2115
03:52:27,360 --> 03:52:33,360
What do you think, to do a bit of a callback, what do you think is the meaning of this whole thing?

2116
03:52:33,360 --> 03:52:38,400
What's the meaning of life? Why are we here? We talked about the rise of human civilization.

2117
03:52:38,400 --> 03:52:45,040
It seems like we're engineers at heart. We build cool stuff, better and better use of energy,

2118
03:52:45,040 --> 03:52:49,920
channeling energy to be productive. Why? What's it all for?

2119
03:52:53,440 --> 03:52:55,120
You're getting metaphysical on me.

2120
03:52:55,120 --> 03:53:00,400
Very. There's a beautiful boat to the left of us. Like, why do we do that? This boat that sailed

2121
03:53:00,400 --> 03:53:05,520
the ocean. Then we build models of it to celebrate great engineering of the past.

2122
03:53:06,480 --> 03:53:12,880
To engineer is divine. You can make lots of arguments as to why we're here. We're here

2123
03:53:12,880 --> 03:53:19,040
to entertain ourself or we're here to create something that's beautiful or something that's

2124
03:53:19,040 --> 03:53:23,440
functional. I think if you're an engineer, you entertain yourself by creating something that's

2125
03:53:23,440 --> 03:53:28,400
both beautiful and functional. So I think all three of those things, it's entertaining, but

2126
03:53:29,040 --> 03:53:38,640
it's ethical. You got to admire the first person that built a bridge, crossing a chasm, or the

2127
03:53:38,640 --> 03:53:44,640
first person to work out the problem of how to get running water to a village. The first person

2128
03:53:44,640 --> 03:53:54,000
to figure out how to dam up a river or mastered agriculture. The guy that figured out how to grow

2129
03:53:54,000 --> 03:53:59,520
fruit on trees or created orchards, and maybe one day had like 10 fruit trees, he's pretty

2130
03:53:59,520 --> 03:54:06,000
proud of himself. So that's functional. There is also something to that, just like you said,

2131
03:54:06,000 --> 03:54:18,080
that's just beautiful. It does get you closer to, like you said, the divine. When you step

2132
03:54:18,080 --> 03:54:26,640
back and look at the entirety of it, a collective of humans using a beautiful invention or creation

2133
03:54:26,640 --> 03:54:37,200
or just something about this instrument is creating a beautiful piece of music. That seems

2134
03:54:37,200 --> 03:54:42,400
just right. That's what we're here for. Whatever the divine is, it seems like we're here for that.

2135
03:54:42,400 --> 03:54:47,360
And I, of course, love talking to you because from the engineering perspective, the function

2136
03:54:47,360 --> 03:54:54,240
is ultimately the mechanism towards the beauty. Isn't there something beautiful about making

2137
03:54:54,240 --> 03:54:59,760
the world a better place for people that you love, your friends, your family, or yourself?

2138
03:55:03,200 --> 03:55:11,840
When you think about the entire arc of human existence and you roll the clock back 500,000

2139
03:55:11,840 --> 03:55:17,040
years and you think about every struggle of everyone that came before us and everything

2140
03:55:17,040 --> 03:55:25,760
they had to overcome in order to put you here right now, you got to admire that, right? You

2141
03:55:25,760 --> 03:55:32,640
got to respect that. That's a heck of a gift they gave us, but it's also a heck of a responsibility.

2142
03:55:33,920 --> 03:55:40,880
Don't screw it up. If I dropped you 500,000 years ago and I said, figure out steel refining,

2143
03:55:40,880 --> 03:55:48,960
or figure out silicon chips, fab reproduction, or whatever it is.

2144
03:55:48,960 --> 03:55:50,560
Fly or fire.

2145
03:55:50,560 --> 03:55:56,000
And so now we're here, and I guess the way you repay them is you fix everything in front of

2146
03:55:56,000 --> 03:56:03,440
your face you can, right? And that means to someone like Elon, it means get us off the planet,

2147
03:56:03,440 --> 03:56:09,840
right? To someone like me, it's like, I think, you know, fix the energy in the system.

2148
03:56:09,840 --> 03:56:13,760
And that gives me hope. Michael, this is an incredible conversation. You're an incredible

2149
03:56:13,760 --> 03:56:18,640
human. It's a huge honor you would sit down with me. Thank you so much for talking to me.

2150
03:56:18,640 --> 03:56:20,080
Yeah, thanks for having me, Lex.

2151
03:56:20,960 --> 03:56:25,280
Thanks for listening to this conversation with Michael Saylor. To support this podcast,

2153
03:56:28,880 --> 03:56:36,720
let me leave you with a few words from Francis Bacon. Money is a great servant, but a bad master.

2154
03:56:36,720 --> 03:56:58,480
Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
