00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,080
The following is a conversation with Robert Breedlove,

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:04,920
someone who caught my attention

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:08,040
and was recommended highly as a rigorous scholar

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,920
and thinker in the space of decentralized finance

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,160
and Bitcoin.

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,200
His podcast titled, What is Money?

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,240
is a good representation of the way his mind works.

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,600
He's willing to talk through ideas for many hours,

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,080
willing to listen, willing to think,

10
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,800
which makes him a great companion in conversation

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,060
to explore the history, philosophy, and future of money.

12
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,760
Quick mention of our sponsors,

13
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,240
Fundrise, Element, MonkPak, and BetterHelp.

14
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,800
Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

15
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,960
As a side note, let me say that I'll have

16
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,040
a number of conversations in the coming months

17
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:49,360
on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

18
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,320
None of these conversations are financial advice.

19
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,640
That's not a legal warning.

20
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,400
That's a genuine description of my goals

21
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,480
and approach with these chats.

22
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,560
At least for a while, I personally won't actively invest

23
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,360
in Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrencies,

24
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,480
except to learn about the technology itself.

25
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,920
I don't think this should be a journalistic standard

26
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,320
like the New York Times trying to establish,

27
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,120
which I very much disagree with.

28
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:16,660
In my humble opinion, I think journalists should be free

29
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,240
to invest in Bitcoin if they want to.

30
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,460
Luckily, I'm not a journalist.

31
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:24,560
I just know my own psychology and I feel that my thinking

32
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,400
will be muddled by excitement

33
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,040
if I invest before I understand.

34
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,360
I feel the same way about Tesla, for example.

35
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,840
I still don't own any Tesla stock

36
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,380
and I am still indeed fascinated by Tesla Autopilot

37
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,520
as an artificial intelligence system.

38
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,640
I work hard to be cognizant of the biases

39
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,320
that arise in my mind and always try to choose the path

40
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:52,080
that maximizes or maintains a freedom of thought

41
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,760
as much as possible.

42
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,240
Also, let me say that I try to be very careful

43
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,460
in selecting guests based not only on the contents

44
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:03,040
of their ideas, but the richness, complexity, music,

45
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,180
style of their mind and character.

46
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:08,060
Yes, I will talk with people with whom you

47
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:12,120
and I may disagree, people who some may call bad

48
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,860
or even evil human beings.

49
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:18,140
I want to understand them because I believe that,

50
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:22,560
as Solzhenitsyn said, the battle line between good and evil

51
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,180
runs through the heart of every man.

52
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,060
I think if you always run from evil,

53
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:30,480
you become blind to the truth of human nature.

54
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,820
This is the Lex Friedman Podcast

55
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:36,380
and here is my conversation with Robert Breedlove.

56
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,080
Rousseau opens his 1762 book,

57
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,420
The Social Contract with the following statement.

58
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:47,480
"'Man is born free and everywhere he's in chains.'"

59
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,840
So you talk about freedom and sovereignty quite a bit.

60
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,680
What do these ideas mean to you, the idea of sovereignty?

61
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,880
Freedom and sovereignty, I think they're very

62
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,060
closely related.

63
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,760
Let's start just focusing on sovereignty,

64
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,860
which is a word I don't think we talk about enough.

65
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,160
And the general definition of that I would give

66
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,140
is the authority to act as you see fit.

67
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,880
And it's a word that's etymologically associated

68
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:19,320
with words like monarchy, money, reign.

69
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:23,560
So historically, it's referred to whatever the locus

70
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,280
of supreme power is in the sphere of human action.

71
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,160
So whether, if you go like back in ancient Egypt,

72
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,440
the Pharaoh had absolute sovereignty

73
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,840
and everyone else was pretty much operating

74
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,840
according to his interest.

75
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,220
You fast forward to today, modern Western democracy,

76
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,400
we have more decentralized sovereignty

77
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,400
and that we all get to go vote and elect officials

78
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,720
that make decisions on our behalf.

79
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:51,020
So the theme of sovereignty across history

80
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,800
is that it's been gradually decentralizing

81
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,440
across our different models of socioeconomics.

82
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:01,140
And it's largely, you could say it's rooted heavily

83
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,120
in the money, I would argue,

84
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,720
which is something we'll get a lot into here,

85
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,360
where if you have money, you have the authority

86
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,080
to act as you see fit in the world.

87
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,200
And even in our current political sphere,

88
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,040
if you have enough money, you can actually reshape the rules.

89
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,240
You can reshape laws, you can lobby Congress.

90
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,700
If you're in a certain situation, like many billionaires,

91
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,720
you can negotiate your own tax treaty

92
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,600
such that you can get favorable tax treatment

93
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,520
with certain jurisdictions in the world.

94
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:35,440
So this concept of sovereignty, which today we call,

95
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,520
it's common to call states or nation states

96
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,160
or government sovereign,

97
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,200
meaning that they have power over people.

98
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,120
But as I argue in a lot of my writing,

99
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,080
I actually think that sovereignty

100
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,020
and here's within the individual

101
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:54,760
and that we each have our own interiorized space of choice,

102
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,620
which is something like Viktor Frankl called

103
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,160
the final human freedom.

104
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,520
And that we, no matter what our circumstances are,

105
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,420
no matter what exogenous situation we face,

106
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,440
we always have this endogenous power

107
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,720
to choose how we respond to it.

108
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,200
That's one of my favorite books is a Man Search for Meaning.

109
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,440
Maybe we can break that apart a little bit.

110
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,880
So you've kind of spoken about sovereignty

111
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,040
as a closely linked to power,

112
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,280
but is there something about your own mind

113
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,440
being able to achieve sovereignty

114
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,280
no matter what the monetary system is,

115
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,280
no matter what, who has the control over centralized power,

116
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:34,080
the money or whatever the mechanisms of sovereignty

117
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,320
and the societal level?

118
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:39,240
You as an individual, isn't ultimately all boiled down

119
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,600
to what you can do with your mind, how you see the world?

120
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,640
How you interpret it.

121
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,080
Yeah, I agree.

122
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,560
And as we get a little bit deeper into this,

123
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,720
I think we'll come to see money

124
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,620
as an extension of your mind.

125
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,600
So there's a feedback between money and mind.

126
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,880
For instance, you think in dollars today,

127
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,480
almost guarantee it, most of us do here in the US.

128
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,240
And it's a tool, right?

129
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,340
It's a tool we're using to decomplexify the world around us,

130
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:08,340
to deal with it, to understand the sacrifices and successes

131
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,880
across an entire history of economic transactions.

132
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,440
We can boil that all down to the price.

133
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,400
So it's data compression.

134
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,400
And if you can change, if there's a central body

135
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,820
or central governance mechanism

136
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:21,920
that can manipulate that money,

137
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,680
it can have an impact on your mind.

138
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,240
For instance, today, so I agree with you on the firsthand,

139
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,160
say that I do believe in free will.

140
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,880
I do believe in individual autonomy,

141
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,200
but I also think that there are certain devices and powers

142
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,760
in the world around us that can actually

143
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,160
influence how we think.

144
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,300
And it's fascinating to think about the fact

145
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,960
that money might be actually deeply integrated

146
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,920
into the way we think and into our mind.

147
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:53,160
Like this is, you think about what are the core aspects

148
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,160
of the human mind?

149
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,000
What influences cognition,

150
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,360
the way you reason about the world?

151
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,200
You have the Chomsky like languages

152
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,120
at the core of everything.

153
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:06,920
But you're kind of placing money as pretty close

154
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,680
to the core of what it means to be

155
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,000
an intelligent reasoning human.

156
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,480
I think money is a direct derivation

157
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,160
of action and speech, actually.

158
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,120
It's another expression of the logos.

159
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,120
If we even think of what it means to think

160
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,920
is that we are generating two different courses of action,

161
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,640
potential courses of action,

162
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,160
and we're populating them with avatars, right?

163
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,720
Maybe ourselves or others.

164
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,040
And then we're comparing how we may act in each situation

165
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,440
and what we think the result would be.

166
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,280
So actually it's comparison.

167
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,920
Basically it's comparison and contrasting

168
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,320
of possible courses of action.

169
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,320
And that's the same thing with words themselves.

170
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:52,320
Like most words, the vast majority of words

171
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,800
only have meaning in relationship to other words, right?

172
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,560
It's all contextual definitions of a word or more words.

173
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,160
Now people have argued with me about this

174
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,840
because there is a first word, right?

175
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,960
Where you pick up rock and say rock.

176
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,360
But most other words in higher abstraction

177
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,480
tend to be relative.

178
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:15,480
And what's funny about action and speech,

179
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,480
and this gets, I got into a bit of this in our paper here,

180
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,840
is that it's linked to evolutionary biology

181
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,520
and that once human beings adopted upright stance,

182
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,040
we freed our hands.

183
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,400
We no longer needed our hands for locomotion.

184
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,120
So we started to evolve more dexterity

185
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,040
and notably we have opposable thumbs.

186
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,600
So this gives us an ability to manipulate

187
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,040
and particularize the environment

188
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,440
in a way that most other animals cannot.

189
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,200
And what's interesting about this is that

190
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:49,080
as we gain this ability to manipulate natural resources

191
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,120
and count, point, pointing was a big deal

192
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,720
and that we could indicate a prey

193
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,680
or items that are far off distance

194
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,280
and we could organize ourselves.

195
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,320
At the same time, we co-evolved this fine musculature

196
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,040
in the face and tongue.

197
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,000
So it's as if speech developed,

198
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,040
co-evolved really with our dexterity.

199
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:15,920
And as a natural extension of that came us making tools.

200
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,480
We started to create things

201
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,360
to better satisfy our wants over time.

202
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,000
And the most tradable tool in any society

203
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,760
or the most tradable thing is money.

204
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:31,320
So I really, I argue that action and speech

205
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,280
are quintessential modes of self-sovereign expression.

206
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,320
And the money is just sort of a tech layer

207
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,920
we've put right on top of that.

208
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:42,320
And that it's a natural derivation of action and speech.

209
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,000
Okay, that's fascinating to think about sovereignty

210
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,280
from the evolutionary perspective.

211
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,240
And then ultimately money is the technology layer

212
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,040
that enables sovereignty.

213
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:57,040
So, it's really fascinating to think about

214
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,720
our modern human society

215
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:03,280
as deeply rooted in these like evolutionary roots

216
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,400
from the very origins of life on earth.

217
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:09,800
So what, you know, some of the ideas you just mentioned,

218
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,120
what do you see are some interesting characteristics

219
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,160
of just life on earth that propagated to us humans?

220
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,960
Like what ideas propagated through,

221
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,560
have roots in the evolution?

222
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:28,080
Yeah, I think one of the deepest impulsions in life

223
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,920
is the territorial imperative.

224
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:35,280
So all life is seeking to expand its dominion

225
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,240
over space and time.

226
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:40,960
And we think about, you know, again, physically with space,

227
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,760
it's advantageous to an animal or an organism

228
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,960
to have more territory under its control

229
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,960
to raise offspring.

230
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,680
So it's all about reproductive fitness

231
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,920
at the end of the day.

232
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,880
And then we'd also think of reproduction itself

233
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,040
as the genetic impulse to have more,

234
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,920
to replicate oneself across time.

235
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,040
So it's territoriality across time in a way.

236
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,080
And this is very common in most animals.

237
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,440
Not all animals are territorial, but many are.

238
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,040
And you see very interesting behaviors

239
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,600
resulting from territoriality.

240
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,000
This is like animal combat, you know,

241
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,680
the reason birds sing is territoriality,

242
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,680
a number of other things.

243
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,640
And it's my hypothesis and others have shared

244
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:28,120
this hypothesis as well, that mankind is clearly,

245
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,320
I think, would argue a territorial species

246
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,200
and that he expresses this territoriality in property rights.

247
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,240
So property, when that word, we hear that word,

248
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,520
we typically think of an asset.

249
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:42,280
We think of, oh, this house or this stock or whatever.

250
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,120
But property is actually the socially acknowledged

251
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,200
relationship between a human and an asset,

252
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,120
such that you have exclusive rights and responsibilities

253
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,880
to a particular asset.

254
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,520
It is not the asset itself.

255
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:59,520
So property, it's information, it's a relationship.

256
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,160
By the way, my mind was just blown.

257
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:04,240
Property is information, it's not the actual asset.

258
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,600
That's really important.

259
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,600
Very important.

260
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,560
That's really interesting.

261
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:12,520
Yeah, and then it comes down to how do we organize ourselves

262
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:17,520
such that property, that the contributions people are making

263
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,200
are commensurate with the consideration they're receiving?

264
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,720
So if you're adding value to a piece of property,

265
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,000
you're developing a piece of land for use.

266
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,840
In theory, to be fair, you should have the rights

267
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,920
to that fruit, right?

268
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,520
If you go out and plant a garden or whatever it may be.

269
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:39,600
And this is rooted in natural law,

270
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,400
where we have rights to life, liberty, and property.

271
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,040
Those are kind of just the base,

272
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,000
the fundamental layer of morality,

273
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,920
the fundamental layer of morality and capitalism, frankly.

274
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,320
And you could think of, to get really primordial with it,

275
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,000
the first capitalist in the world,

276
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,720
just to kind of get some definitions out here,

277
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:04,000
I'll say capitalism versus communism or socialism

278
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,080
as the spectrum I'll speak on.

279
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:09,440
The first capitalist in the world would be the guy,

280
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,400
the caveman that maybe dug a little hole for himself

281
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,960
to shield himself from the elements, right?

282
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,280
Maybe there was a rainstorm or a snowstorm

283
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,640
and he dug a little enclave and he protected himself.

284
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,960
I thought you were gonna go, because you said primordial,

285
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,840
I thought you were gonna go back

286
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,160
to earlier biological systems.

287
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,160
I guess primordial for human, perhaps.

288
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,240
For humans, yeah, okay.

289
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,080
And then the first communist or socialist

290
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:37,360
would be someone that decided the fruits of his labor

291
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,800
belonged to him.

292
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,280
So he would have violently encroached on that individual

293
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:45,200
and taken his plot for himself, for his own use.

294
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:50,200
And that's the spectrum across which capitalism

295
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,600
in the pure sense and communism in the pure sense operate

296
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,680
in that capitalism, each individual has the exclusive rights

297
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,240
to the fruits of their labor.

298
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,200
So anything they spend their time, effort, energy

299
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,000
creating in the world, they own the rights to that

300
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,120
and they can trade those rights with others,

301
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,440
other self-owned people that have done similar things.

302
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,800
Communism or socialism would imply that other people,

303
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,080
typically the state, have the rights, at least some rights

304
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,640
to the value you've created.

305
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,560
So there's this interesting moment when that first caveman,

306
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:27,480
that first capitalist drew a line, a circle in this cave

307
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,000
and said, this is mine.

308
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,320
You could say it was free to be claimed

309
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,720
at the time he claimed it.

310
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:41,400
But it's an interesting moment when asset becomes an asset,

311
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,280
when space-time, as you were referring to,

312
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,760
it becomes something that's now,

313
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,720
can be possessed by a human being.

314
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,880
Is there something special about this moment?

315
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,600
Because it feels like, first of all,

316
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,080
in terms of space and time,

317
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,840
it feels like there's a lot of available space-time

318
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,480
yet to be claimed.

319
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,280
So if we just look at like the universe, right?

320
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,840
We're talking about, there's a funny thing

321
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,800
with Elon Musk and Mars.

322
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,600
I think they sneaked in there for SpaceX

323
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:17,440
that nobody on earth has any authority on Mars or any.

324
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,880
This is a very interesting question.

325
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,880
It seems almost like humorous at this time,

326
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,480
but perhaps not.

327
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,080
Perhaps there'll be sections of space,

328
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:28,920
not just on planets, that are gonna be even fought over.

329
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,880
So is there something special about this moment?

330
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:35,000
Because in discussing sort of violence

331
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,560
and respect for property,

332
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,120
it feels like this is a special moment,

333
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,600
because ultimately conflict arises

334
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:46,560
when you make claims on a particular territory.

335
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,080
It's not always in conflict where people say,

336
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,680
when you look at Hitler or something, for example,

337
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,520
his claim would be in many of the lands

338
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,120
that he attacked and invaded,

339
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:02,600
that this is ultimately, this has always belonged to Germany.

340
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,760
So is there something you could say

341
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:09,360
as to like what it means to own an asset or a property?

342
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,880
Yeah, so in the ancient days of hunters and gatherers,

343
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:18,880
we could say that property was mostly a loyal title,

344
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,240
which meant it's just whatever you can defend, right?

345
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,520
So if you've got knives and daggers and satchels

346
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,680
and maybe some pelts you've hunted,

347
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:32,080
whatever you can hold and defend is yours.

348
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:35,240
And there's not like, there's a government to appeal to.

349
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:39,040
You're just sort of a free agent operating in the wild,

350
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,600
defending the assets you can protect on you, more or less.

351
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:48,280
And what really changed the nature of property

352
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,680
is when we get into the agricultural age.

353
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:55,160
So there's a big flip where we went from just foraging

354
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,200
and hunting all the time, constantly moving,

355
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,320
trying to stay alive to deciding we're gonna settle here.

356
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,080
We figured out how to cultivate crops.

357
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,960
We can create, we can increase the population

358
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,360
because we can harvest more energy from the sun

359
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,160
and we can establish a longer term civilization.

360
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,480
What happens in that transition

361
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,360
is that we begin creating economic surplus.

362
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,560
So for the first time in history,

363
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:21,920
we have stock houses of grain to defend

364
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,360
or maybe meat or cattle or whatever it is

365
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,920
we're creating, we now have savings.

366
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:32,880
And it's at that time when government emerges as well,

367
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,040
because once you have savings

368
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,240
or you have an economic surplus,

369
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,200
you have something that other people want to steal.

370
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,680
This one thing we'll touch on a lot today

371
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,200
is people always want something for nothing.

372
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,360
People are always seeking the path

373
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,280
to get something for nothing.

374
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,520
And I think that drives a lot of our decision-making

375
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,600
and it actually encourages us to be innovative

376
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,440
in a lot of ways, right?

377
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,960
We're trying to, you could say it's our laziness

378
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,680
that's helping us be inventive in a way.

379
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,320
We're trying to accomplish greater results

380
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,840
with less efforts over time,

381
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:07,320
but we can cross that line in seeking something for nothing

382
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,160
where we start to violate the life, liberty

383
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,200
and property of others.

384
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,080
And that's where we shift from kind of capitalistic society

385
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,480
to something more communistic.

386
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,760
And so that's what government is.

387
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,600
It's a protection producing enterprise

388
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,760
for the economic surplus generated by a trading society.

389
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,360
So when people begin to trade,

390
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,840
they create what's called the division of labor,

391
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,920
which is a very common economics term,

392
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,320
basically means you're better at making hats,

393
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,320
I'm better at making boots.

394
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,920
If you and I, you specialize in hats,

395
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,480
I specialize in boots and we trade,

396
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,480
we've created a positive sum game

397
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,720
where you and I both benefit.

398
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,880
So we become collectively more than the sum of our parts

399
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,200
through trade.

400
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,240
And that's why human beings do trade,

401
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,880
because we become more energy efficient as a result.

402
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,400
We create more outputs per unit of input.

403
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,120
And you can think of government in that respect,

404
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,080
if we're looking at it, maybe in a tech sense

405
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:05,080
that the economy is the trade network that generates wealth,

406
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,040
generates innovation, generates all,

407
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,960
this whole lap of luxury we live in today

408
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,560
that we've inherited from our forebears is from the market.

409
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,000
It's not from a government.

410
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,360
The government is the network security, if you will.

411
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,200
So we're paying expenses to a vendor

412
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,680
to protect peace, to preserve life, liberty,

413
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,320
and property in that network,

414
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,600
so that we can have,

415
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,960
when there's inevitably disputes over private property,

416
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,560
we can have nonviolent dispute resolution

417
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,840
in the rule of law.

418
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,880
And we can have a reasonable expectation

419
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,280
of being able to conduct commerce without violence.

420
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:43,800
The problem has been that the protector tends to,

421
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,920
they're in a monopolistic position, we would say,

422
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:49,120
they tend to start abusing that position

423
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,920
to obtain property for themselves.

424
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,720
Again, trying to get that something for nothing.

425
00:19:55,720 --> 00:20:00,200
When you control, you are the security guard

426
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,080
for the economy.

427
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,560
The first thing they tend to monopolize is money,

428
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,720
because if you can control the money,

429
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,960
you're effectively controlling people, their energy,

430
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,120
their perceptions.

431
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:14,440
And that becomes a, particularly through inflation,

432
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:17,400
becomes an avenue to get something for nothing.

433
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,920
And that you can just print more money

434
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,280
that everyone else is forced to sacrifice

435
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,000
their time and energy to obtain.

436
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,480
What are your thoughts about anarchism?

437
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:30,840
So I talk quite a bit, he'll be here in a few days,

438
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:35,360
actually, Michael Malice, about ideas of anarchy.

439
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,040
And his idea, or the idea of anarchists,

440
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,800
is that any amount of government

441
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:44,080
will eventually become the very kind of thing

442
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,560
that you're referring to.

443
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:48,360
So there's almost no way to have a government

444
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:52,640
that doesn't then try to monopolize power, money,

445
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,240
and all those kinds of things.

446
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,800
Do you think it's possible to have a government

447
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,640
sort of on that spectrum of like anarchy,

448
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,920
maybe libertarianism?

449
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,520
I'm not sure how exactly the spectrum goes,

450
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,040
but where you have a small government

451
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,920
that protects the liberty and property rights

452
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,600
and those kinds of things,

453
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:15,320
and doesn't expand to then also control the monetary system

454
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:18,440
and all those other things, is it possible?

455
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,800
Agreed completely.

456
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:23,000
It was not possible until Satoshi Nakamoto.

457
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,520
So for the first time in history,

458
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,080
we have a money that cannot be monopolized,

459
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,920
cannot be corrupted, cannot be changed,

460
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,360
cannot be weaponized, frankly.

461
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,600
Our current monetary system is weaponized

462
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,320
by those who can print money against those who cannot.

463
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:43,320
And I think when you have, you know,

464
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,000
at the heart of every modern economy,

465
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,840
which even we could say the US,

466
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,440
we pride ourselves as free market capitalists.

467
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,440
You know, we out competed communism in the 20th century.

468
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,440
We think that this is the superior model.

469
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,520
Most business people will tell you that the free market

470
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,400
is the best allocator of resources, all of these things.

471
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,600
But what we have at the heart of every modern economy,

472
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,760
including the US, is an anti-capitalist model.

473
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,920
It is an anti-capitalistic institution,

474
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,200
which is the central bank.

475
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,520
The temptation to monopolize money throughout all of history

476
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,840
has been too strong for anyone to resist.

477
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:22,200
So any, even benevolent quote unquote dictators

478
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,040
that have taken over, many dictators have inherited,

479
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:28,440
say an inflationary regime, where society's coming apart

480
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,760
because someone was clipping the coins

481
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,400
or someone was printing too much money,

482
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,320
and they'll commit to going back to a hard money standard.

483
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,000
So they'll keep society on a gold standard, for instance,

484
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,920
such that they cannot violate the money

485
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,160
to benefit themselves.

486
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,440
But inevitably over time,

487
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:48,760
because it is a political institution,

488
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,720
there's an incentive there, right?

489
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,200
For, again, to get something for nothing,

490
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,320
to spend more than you're making through tax revenues.

491
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:00,360
And with that incentive, people typically ultimately

492
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,600
end up pursuing that inflationary path.

493
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,760
So we can get deeper into that about,

494
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,480
inflation is a term that we've been conditioned

495
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,040
to think today is just something normal.

496
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,200
The prices just go up,

497
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:16,640
and then it's pertinent to a healthy economy,

498
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,880
but it's actually,

499
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,360
if you look at it from real first principles,

500
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,600
it is just theft integrated into the money.

501
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,040
It's a technology backdoor,

502
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,480
is another way to think about it.

503
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,000
You wouldn't buy a cell phone

504
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,520
knowing that someone could siphon your data

505
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,080
off of your private calls and sell it into the market.

506
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,760
Now, I know we do that with a lot of social media stuff

507
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,280
today, and that's something else we can get into,

508
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,360
but you wouldn't do it willingly, right?

509
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,360
You would prefer that your cell phone and your data

510
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:43,200
was monetized by you, or if you're gonna sell it,

511
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,480
you would be able to selectively sell it.

512
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:49,160
Inflation is that it's similar, it's a tech backdoor.

513
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:53,560
So it's a money that only a few people

514
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:56,320
can siphon value off of surreptitiously,

515
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,160
typically slowly, but eventually,

516
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,160
as we've seen throughout history,

517
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,640
that slowly builds up into a rapidly

518
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,880
and then causes the monetary system to collapse.

519
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,480
Do you think there's a benefit to inflation, possibly?

520
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,440
So when you have perfect information,

521
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,360
but perhaps you don't need inflation,

522
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,120
perhaps it is purely theft,

523
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,640
but I think of inflation as like the snooze button

524
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,600
on the alarm.

525
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,560
So if you have a hard standard,

526
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,920
you better wake up when the alarm rings,

527
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:29,440
but all of us kind of like probably shouldn't,

528
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,800
but use the snooze button.

529
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,240
It's like, okay, well, five more minutes or 10 more minutes.

530
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:37,040
And then you're saying there's naturally a slippery slope

531
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:40,200
where it becomes a drug that you fall in love with

532
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,880
in your abuse.

533
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:46,320
But nevertheless, the usefulness of the snooze button

534
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,880
is that you don't know how you'll be actually feeling

535
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,360
when the alarm rings.

536
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,240
You might be able to ready to pop up,

537
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,480
or you might be like, you really need those few more minutes

538
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,600
to psychologically get yourself out of bed.

539
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,560
This metaphor is just not working at all.

540
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:05,000
But do you think there's a use to inflation sometimes

541
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,040
from like an economics perspective?

542
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,800
I think the drug metaphor is a little more apt

543
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,440
in that inflation does provide

544
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:17,440
an immediately stimulative effect when used early on.

545
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:23,160
But what it's doing is it's, again,

546
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:26,320
we talk about the balance between incentives

547
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,520
and disincentives, right?

548
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:31,080
That being necessary for a system to function properly.

549
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,160
With inflation, you're essentially giving

550
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,360
the people that can print money

551
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,840
a way to dampen the disincentives they face.

552
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:45,840
So it destroys feedback loops, I guess you might say.

553
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,440
And another way to look at this is when you,

554
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,360
so using inflation, using quantitative easing,

555
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:56,960
you can decrease short-term volatility in the marketplace.

556
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:01,160
So the market is basically this idea,

557
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,320
this form of free exchange that's trying to zero in

558
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,520
on the best ideas.

559
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:07,080
And the ideas are those that are most fit to reality,

560
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,840
to satisfying the most wants.

561
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,400
It's gonna overshoot, it's gonna undershoot,

562
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,040
you have these little business cycles.

563
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,560
But when it's undershooting

564
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:16,880
and you're experiencing a business recession,

565
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,200
in a capitalist environment,

566
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,000
the market needs to clear that malinvestment,

567
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,320
that misallocation of capital.

568
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,440
That means someone made a bet on a certain idea

569
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,840
that it would satisfy wants in a particular way,

570
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,480
and that bet did not pan out.

571
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,480
If you then paper over the losses

572
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,040
that business is creating,

573
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:36,880
you're now delaying and exacerbating the volatility

574
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,200
that that idea created.

575
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,440
So this is kind of a Tel Aviv concept

576
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:46,120
where you can dampen short-run volatility,

577
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,360
but volatility is truth.

578
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:53,360
Volatility is us matching our ideas to reality, right?

579
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,240
We're constantly, again, overshooting and undershooting.

580
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:58,920
So you delay volatility, you're just amplifying it

581
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,200
and exacerbating it in the long run.

582
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,760
And that's what Central Bank is doing.

583
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:06,880
The Central Bank mandate is low unemployment

584
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:11,280
and low unexpected inflation, basically.

585
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:16,840
And so they're trying to achieve economic growth

586
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:19,520
in a stable way, quote unquote, stable way.

587
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,200
This is their ostensible purpose.

588
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,960
And that's just not possible.

589
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,720
Growth is an inherently unstable process.

590
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,400
Can you elaborate a little bit about

591
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,360
the nature of volatility?

592
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,840
Why is it communicating truth?

593
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,040
That's something that a lot of people are afraid of

594
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:44,040
is the volatility, almost like it's a sign of chaos.

595
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:48,240
And so they want to escape chaos.

596
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,760
But you're saying that that's actually,

597
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,640
whether it's chaos or not, I don't know,

598
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:57,600
but it's getting us closer to the fundamental reality

599
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,080
that we should not be trying to escape.

600
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:04,960
Yeah, so if we consider that the universe

601
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,960
is pervaded by entropy, right?

602
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,760
This is the second law of thermodynamics

603
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,080
is that every closed system

604
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,600
tends towards greater disorder over time.

605
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,880
And that life itself, again, I would argue,

606
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,760
expressed through the logos,

607
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:22,160
we, life, is the anti-entropic principle.

608
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,720
It's the only thing that's converting entropy into order,

609
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,520
chaos into order.

610
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:29,960
And that's what entrepreneurs are doing, right?

611
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,720
We're living at the edges of the known

612
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,720
and we're trying to,

613
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,240
we're testing ourselves against the entropy of nature,

614
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,920
trying to figure out new and better ways

615
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,040
of saying, doing, or making things.

616
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:44,280
And then if we do crack a code or figure something out,

617
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,680
we then have a big incentive,

618
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,160
the incentive is to get rich, right?

619
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,400
Because then you have a new idea

620
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,920
that you could then sell back into the marketplace.

621
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:55,920
So it's this sequence of courageously confronting

622
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,720
the entropy of nature

623
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,840
and converting it into good and useful order,

624
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:04,120
which by the way is like the ancient idea of God and Genesis,

625
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,600
which I think is interesting,

626
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:10,120
that actually enables us to construct civilization

627
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:14,920
in these layers of anti-entropy or order, you might say.

628
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:20,920
So today we live in a bubble of anti-entropy or order.

629
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:23,320
Like the coastlines are guarded by the nation

630
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:26,360
and the city has a certain police force

631
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,680
that keeps it in order.

632
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,640
Even the way we talk,

633
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:34,040
clearly the words matter, but also the nonverbal cues,

634
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,400
all these things are like order that has been established

635
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:40,800
over many, many, many thousands of years of human evolution.

636
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:45,800
And I think that's, when I say volatility is truth,

637
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,400
what I'm saying is that the experience of uncertainty

638
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:52,680
is something that's ineradicable from life, right?

639
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:56,240
Uncertainty, like it's kind of a paradox

640
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,200
because we're fighting against it, right?

641
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,680
We're trying to innovate our way away from uncertainty

642
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,840
to create more capital,

643
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:07,840
which capital is very simply a way of mitigating uncertainty.

644
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,640
So this is why you might have like a stash of food

645
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,920
in case the power goes out or a generator,

646
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:15,600
like it helps you overcome uncertainty over time.

647
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,600
But uncertainty is also where all the sweetness of life is.

648
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,880
So there's gotta be this balance

649
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,680
with one foot in, one foot out.

650
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,520
And-

651
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,800
So human society is this kind of bubble of order

652
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,680
that we've constructed and slowly expanding,

653
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,440
but at the edges, you're always going to have that chaos,

654
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,440
that volatility, and that the entrepreneurs

655
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:37,600
are kind of like jumping in and out of the bubble.

656
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,520
Jumping into that chaos,

657
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,040
and some of them die and some of them succeed.

658
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:46,400
And so like, if you wanna grow this bubble of order,

659
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:51,400
you have to be embracing the volatility at the edges.

660
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,280
Yes.

661
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,120
And reverence for entrepreneurship,

662
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,960
because these are the people putting their neck out,

663
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,320
so to speak, risking themselves.

664
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,240
And they're gonna contribute to society, by the way,

665
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,120
whether they go up in flames or not.

666
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,760
If they go up in flames, society has witnessed

667
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,640
their experience as something not to do

668
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,680
or something that doesn't work

669
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,400
in a particular time and place,

670
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,840
so that you could say them going up in flames

671
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,840
is a way of enlightening the rest of us.

672
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,000
Or if they figure something out,

673
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,800
Steve Jobs creates the iPhone, changes the world forever.

674
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,800
So enlightening the rest of us, okay.

675
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,960
And Taleb would say-

676
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,640
The fire of their failure, okay.

677
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,040
Yeah, exactly.

678
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:35,040
Taleb would say individual fragility

679
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:38,600
is inseparable from ensemble anti-fragility.

680
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,640
So this means that, again,

681
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,760
every time that entrepreneur goes up in flames,

682
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:46,040
or say a restaurant goes out of business,

683
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,400
when a restaurant goes out of business,

684
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,240
that particular cuisine strategy they were implementing

685
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,600
in that particular time and place,

686
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,520
that's a signal to all the other restaurants in the area

687
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,920
that that doesn't work.

688
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:59,680
So restaurant food improves from bankruptcy to bankruptcy.

689
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:02,440
So it's this death of the individual components

690
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:05,480
that contributes to the growth of the ensemble.

691
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,880
As a small aside, maybe you can guide me through it.

692
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,320
I don't know if you're paying attention,

693
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:13,800
but there was some chaos around Taleb

694
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,600
and the Bitcoin community.

695
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,960
I wasn't quite paying attention,

696
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,200
but from my outsider's perspective,

697
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:24,520
I thought Nassim Taleb was a supporter of Bitcoin.

698
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,880
And then a lot of people were very upset about something.

699
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,240
I'm sorry if I don't know the details,

700
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:33,040
but can you pull out some profound philosophical ideas

701
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,880
from the disagreement of the chaos?

702
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,960
I admittedly don't know too much about it either.

703
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,160
I'm a big fan of his writing.

704
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:45,760
He's always been a little different in person.

705
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,520
Like I actually, he signed one of my books.

706
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,360
I met him in person.

707
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,640
He's got a very abrasive personality.

708
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,320
He's kind of known for it.

709
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,120
I don't think I'm passing any judgment here.

710
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,000
He sort of embraces it.

711
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
But he had written the forward

712
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,720
to a really important book in Bitcoin

713
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,840
called the Bitcoin Standard for Safedean Amoose.

714
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,920
And then I think they had a little Twitter beef

715
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:10,920
because Safedean is very much against COVID mask

716
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,760
and state intervention,

717
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:15,400
whereas Taleb's on the other side of the fence.

718
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,960
And so, and then after that beef,

719
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,720
Taleb came out against Bitcoiners saying,

720
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,880
oh, Bitcoiners are crazy and wrong.

721
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,760
I think the great mask debate of the 2020

722
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,720
will probably be the thing that ultimately leads

723
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,440
to World War III.

724
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,440
I've been very surprised how tense,

725
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:36,440
how much like division this one little arguably silly thing

726
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,200
has led to.

727
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,640
I think a lot of people sort of project their,

728
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,080
like it's almost like not wearing a mask

729
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,560
is a statement of sovereignty of freedom

730
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,920
of like saying fuck you to the man,

731
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:51,000
the government, the centralized power,

732
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,240
or the dishonesty or in the scientific community,

733
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,320
all those kinds of things.

734
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:59,600
And then wearing a mask is a sort of kind of signaling

735
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:03,680
of various kind of social aspects.

736
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,600
I don't know, I'm not paying attention to it.

737
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,920
I actually tuned out.

738
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,560
I was part of a group of scientists

739
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,640
that were looking into like do masks work?

740
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,080
This very interesting question.

741
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,960
To me, it was an interesting question.

742
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:17,680
I sort of roll in to ask that very interesting question

743
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:20,560
because I think it is an interesting scientific question,

744
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:23,880
but then I quickly realized that just as I was doing this

745
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:27,600
like scientific exploration of this very interesting question

746
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,360
about Viron particles, like what kind of things,

747
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,360
like from a scientific perspective,

748
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,440
how do we prevent the spread of a pandemic?

749
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:38,080
Forget COVID, any pandemic, super deadly or not deadly.

750
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,720
Like there's tools, there's testing, there's masks,

751
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:43,240
there's all these tools, how well do they work?

752
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:46,760
And then I realized in April or so,

753
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:50,040
it became a tool of politics, a tool of philosophy.

754
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,960
And that's when I sort of pulled out.

755
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:52,800
So it's fascinating.

756
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,760
I think it's a canvas on which people project

757
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,960
their emotions and I guess Tillam got caught up

758
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:02,520
in that kind of, so there's nothing fundamental,

759
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,560
I suppose, to their disagreement.

760
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:09,560
Not that I'm aware of, but he's written some about

761
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:13,240
in his books, the problem with centralization.

762
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,880
I mean, a lot of his writing addresses that.

763
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,640
And he actually points to, I think Switzerland

764
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,320
is the best government in the world

765
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,720
because it's decentralized.

766
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,120
So there's that.

767
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:28,440
I don't think he has any, not to speak for him,

768
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:32,880
but I don't think he's voiced any specific critiques

769
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,680
on Bitcoin per se.

770
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,760
Could be wrong about that.

771
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,840
It's just maybe his flavorful language

772
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,600
and the way he likes to communicate.

773
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,320
And the other theory is that maybe he's playing 4D chess

774
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,640
and having a Twitter boating accident.

775
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:48,160
So I don't believe in Bitcoin, I've sold all my Bitcoin.

776
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,080
Oh, I see.

777
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,800
Sorry, the boating accident in Bitcoin is this,

778
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,760
I guess it's proverbial by this point

779
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:59,400
where it's the way you lose your Bitcoin.

780
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,920
So if someone comes after you and says,

781
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:03,560
hey, whether it's a government or an individual

782
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,240
is coming after you saying, give me all your Bitcoin

783
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,920
or pay these taxes in Bitcoin, you go,

784
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:09,080
oh, I had a boating accident and lost them all.

785
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:09,920
Lost them all.

786
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,520
But back to the fundamental nature of space-time.

787
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:20,200
Let me ask you, because we're kind of left it.

788
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:24,920
I'd like to go back to this idea of that you said

789
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:27,360
that everything we think, say or do occurs

790
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,120
within the bounds of space-time.

791
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,600
So first of all, maybe you can comment on

792
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:37,120
what do you mean in this context about space-time,

793
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:40,680
but also about the nature of truth,

794
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:43,480
like how much of all of this is knowable?

795
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:46,400
How much of this is accessible to us humans?

796
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,160
How much uncertainty like we're talking about

797
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,720
is there in the world?

798
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,280
Are you, do you fall in a place

799
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:56,040
where we can reason deeply about this world

800
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,520
and it's knowable or is it mostly chaos

801
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:01,360
and we're just holding on for dear life?

802
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:04,200
Yeah, I think I said that all action occurs

803
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,520
within the bounds of space-time.

804
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,160
The other thing, everything we say do or make,

805
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,360
the other thing is that everything we say do or make

806
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,440
starts out as an idea.

807
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:15,480
So there's this concept of universal Darwinism,

808
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:20,040
which basically applies Darwinian principles,

809
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,920
but outside of the biological sphere.

810
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,600
So we could say that this kind of gets

811
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,120
into Richard Dawkins memetics,

812
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:29,160
that even ideas are competing, reproducing, recombining.

813
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,840
That idea is so powerful, by the way.

814
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:33,880
I don't think it's been understood fully.

815
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:38,880
I think in the digital, in the 21st century

816
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,560
in the digital world, from my perspective

817
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,480
in artificial intelligence,

818
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,200
there's yet to be some profound things to be discovered

819
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,200
about this whole construct.

820
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,840
Agreed completely.

821
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,480
It's been called an acid, actually,

822
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:55,560
in that it strips away all of the non-informational

823
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,440
components of something,

824
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,360
just strips it down to its bare bones.

825
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:02,160
I have a quote in here somewhere about that, but-

826
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,120
I'm sorry, which is called an acid, the ideas?

827
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,840
The universal Darwinism.

828
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:08,200
Darwinism applied broadly outside of the-

829
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:12,720
Applied broadly, and I'll condition all of this

830
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,480
with saying that a lot, most of my thinking

831
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,240
is shaped by a book I read recently

832
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,840
called The Case Against Reality,

833
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,600
which introduced me to this concept,

834
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,800
but it tied into Darwinism

835
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,200
that I've used more broadly in the past,

836
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,280
looking at things like money and economics.

837
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:30,600
So the book, The Case Against Reality by Donald Hoffman,

838
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,800
he has a quote in the book

839
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,720
that describes universal Darwinism.

840
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,600
It says, quote, universal Darwinism can,

841
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:41,480
without risk of refuting itself, address our key question.

842
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:44,840
Does natural selection favor true perceptions?

843
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,760
If the answer happens to be no,

844
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:49,160
then it hasn't shot itself in the foot.

845
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,280
The uncanny power of universal Darwinism

846
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,120
has been likened by the philosopher Dan Dennett

847
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,680
to a universal acid.

848
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,960
And Dan Dennett says, quote,

849
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,920
there is no denying at this point

850
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,400
that Darwin's idea is a universal solvent

851
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,000
capable of cutting right to the heart

852
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,720
of everything in sight.

853
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:08,520
The question is, what does it leave behind?

854
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,880
I have tried to show that once it passes through everything,

855
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,120
we are left with stronger, sounder versions

856
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,800
of our most important ideas.

857
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,920
Some of the traditional details perish,

858
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,400
and some of these are losses to be regretted,

859
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,240
but good riddance to the rest of them.

860
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,200
What remains is more than enough to build on, unquote.

861
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:31,360
So the way I would interpret that is that life itself,

862
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,080
I've come to view life

863
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,600
as information propagating through flesh,

864
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:40,600
and that we are, I guess, DNA is a quadratic code.

865
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,200
I think it's four letters maybe

866
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,440
versus a binary zeros and ones.

867
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,080
And we are ideas, we are strategies

868
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,720
competing with each other.

869
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:53,280
And nature is that which selects,

870
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,400
it's what selects the winning ideas,

871
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,760
the ones that are most fit

872
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,600
to environmental conditions, frankly.

873
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:04,760
Talking about sovereignty and individualism,

874
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,640
there might need to be some rethinking here

875
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,800
about what is actually the basic individual entity

876
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,640
that is to be sovereign.

877
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:18,640
Like maybe our biological meat vehicles

878
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:21,280
were like way overly attached to them.

879
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,920
Like maybe, especially with genetics

880
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:26,920
and all those kinds of things,

881
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:29,280
or artificial intelligence, or living things,

882
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,160
artificial intelligence, or living more and more

883
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:34,240
in virtual worlds will become detached

884
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,920
from that kind of idea.

885
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,960
So for example, if I can clone you,

886
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,960
make 1 million robbers,

887
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,200
but you all have the same idea,

888
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,920
what is your real value as the,

889
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,040
like I could just shoot you

890
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,880
and there'll still be 999 of you,

891
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,200
but the idea is the important thing,

892
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,160
the things you believe, so.

893
00:40:57,160 --> 00:41:00,200
I would argue that I don't know,

894
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,080
even if you clone someone perfectly,

895
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,840
I don't think you can reproduce

896
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,480
the individual themselves,

897
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:09,000
because we're all a product of nature and nurture, right?

898
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,360
So my particular concourse of experiences,

899
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:15,800
the path dependence that I represent cannot be replicated,

900
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,560
nor can anyone's for that matter.

901
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,240
Well, that's a hypothesis.

902
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:27,240
So that's of course a human meat bag would say, so.

903
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,080
Good point.

904
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:31,920
So like desperately trying to preserve himself,

905
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,960
you know, I think it reduces

906
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:36,440
to some fundamental questions about what is consciousness

907
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,000
and whether that can be cloned,

908
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,200
all those kinds, you know,

909
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,880
it gets to the core of what it is to be human.

910
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:45,160
What are the things that make you particularly you?

911
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,880
Yeah, I think it would assume

912
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,200
kind of a materialist viewpoint on reality,

913
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:52,160
and that if you could reproduce every atom of an individual

914
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:55,160
that you would have their experience encapsulated in that.

915
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:58,640
And you know, Hoffman's, which is the book is very radical.

916
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:03,640
He argues that space and time is not an objective reality,

917
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:06,080
it's a biological interface.

918
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:11,080
So we are scanning our environment for fitness payoffs,

919
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:13,520
and this space and time is the rendering

920
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,880
specific to human beings that allows us to navigate reality

921
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:18,960
effectively.

922
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,880
So the further argument would be that we all have

923
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,240
pretty similar interfaces,

924
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,000
but they're all slightly different too,

925
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,120
because we're all, you know, adapting in different ways

926
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:30,320
and that different animals have their own unique interfaces.

927
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,800
So we have a certain amount of photoreceptors in our eye,

928
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,920
whereas I think the number is three, might be five,

929
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:39,320
or something like the mantis shrimp has like seven or nine.

930
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:44,320
So they can see, and we only see one 10 trillionth

931
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,040
of the light spectrum.

932
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,680
So talk about a tiny fraction.

933
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:51,680
I mean, one 10 trillionth is a very minuscule number,

934
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,360
and that makes up all of the light

935
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:55,360
that we can interpret with our eyes,

936
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:57,040
but it's something like a mantis shrimp could see,

937
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,800
you know, much more of that.

938
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,920
So I think there's this,

939
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:06,040
we're very conditioned to have a fully materialist viewpoint

940
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,320
on reality today,

941
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:10,320
where we think, you know,

942
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:13,000
the atomic clockwork kind of universe.

943
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,520
But I think there's, I don't think that's true exactly.

944
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:19,800
And another school that goes into that

945
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:22,040
is actually Austrian economics,

946
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:24,680
where we could say that, you know,

947
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:27,640
we mentioned earlier that an asset is not property.

948
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:29,160
It's actually based on the relationship

949
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:31,160
between the individual and the property.

950
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:35,720
There's this whole realm of relevance

951
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:40,720
associated with, we're all moving through life

952
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,560
in the course of a goal-directed action.

953
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:47,440
So when we walk across a room, I go from A to B,

954
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,200
it's because I valued B more than A.

955
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,960
So value is inseparable from human action.

956
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,200
We have a rank ordered value system in our mind,

957
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,400
each of us, and we're constantly taking action

958
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,480
in accordance with those rank values.

959
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,520
Anything that accelerates us

960
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,840
on the course of our goal-directed action

961
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:08,480
towards our goal is useful.

962
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:12,720
Anything that impedes us, or we could say is valuable,

963
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:16,200
anything that impedes us is actually obstructing to value.

964
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:19,160
And anything that's irrelevant is just valueless.

965
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:23,880
So this table that we're using right now,

966
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:26,360
like this is an accessory to UNI

967
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:27,480
because it's holding this paper

968
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:28,480
that's holding the information

969
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,320
that's guiding our conversation.

970
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:34,320
But we could pay someone $100 to jump over this table.

971
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,520
And this table could simultaneously be an accessory

972
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:39,480
to UNI and an obstacle to someone else.

973
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:43,880
So it's this domain, this silent contention of willpower

974
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:46,760
and agendas occurring across the face of the earth

975
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:50,040
that is what Austrian economics really looks at.

976
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:54,040
It's the realm of human action, as they call it.

977
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:55,560
It's called praxeology.

978
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:58,560
So it's a non-materialist viewpoint on reality

979
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:03,240
and that things, we think in terms of matter being reality,

980
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:06,160
but it's often more so in the sphere of human action,

981
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,640
what matters, that is reality.

982
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,240
It's the relevance of a thing

983
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,440
to the course of one's goal-directed action.

984
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:16,000
And that's ultimately exists in the space of ideas.

985
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:16,960
Yes.

986
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,080
Not in the space of physical matter.

987
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:20,440
And just to jump back to this line here,

988
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:24,640
I think his fundamental line here is the question is,

989
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,920
talking about universal Darwinism as an asset,

990
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:28,400
what does it leave behind?

991
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,800
I've tried to show that once it passes through everything,

992
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,960
we're left with stronger, sounder versions

993
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,360
of our most useful ideas.

994
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:36,560
That's the key point to me.

995
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:40,440
And that ideas and information, so far as we can tell,

996
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:43,280
are the most fundamental substrate of reality.

997
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:47,600
And information itself, back to entropy,

998
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:50,360
information is the resolution of entropy.

999
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:51,600
That's what the bit is, right?

1000
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:52,480
It's a one or zero.

1001
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:55,080
Whatever reduces your entropy by half is a bit.

1002
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:57,520
And we measure information in bits.

1003
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:00,880
So, and you're right, people don't have ideas.

1004
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:02,000
Ideas have people.

1005
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:05,840
Honestly, it's a really profound idea

1006
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:11,640
or a statement about reality, a reframing of reality.

1007
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,360
If we're actually being deeply honest about it,

1008
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:17,240
it's quite painful.

1009
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:19,320
I do appreciate that you defended

1010
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:21,760
your biological meatbag earlier,

1011
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:26,040
but it seems like ideas are the things that have power.

1012
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:31,040
That me, Lex, for example, is worthless.

1013
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:35,840
And relative to the ideas that used my brain

1014
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:37,640
for a bit of a time.

1015
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:39,800
But so far as we know,

1016
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,440
only human beings can generate and share ideas.

1017
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:44,480
So you can't say Lex is worthless.

1018
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:47,960
Like you are the node of the idea sphere.

1019
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:49,120
I'm like the newest sphere.

1020
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:52,080
So I'm, what is it?

1021
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:55,200
From a Bitcoin perspective, I'm like, I'm mining,

1022
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,400
I'm solving the cryptographic problem

1023
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:02,400
and generating, in that sense, I'm a useful node.

1024
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:06,920
Yeah, you're competing to solve the puzzle of entropy, right?

1025
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:09,640
And when you do solve it, it benefits the entire network.

1026
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:13,400
But I guess from my perspective,

1027
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,440
just because just working in AI,

1028
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,640
I'm looking at the long-term vision.

1029
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:22,560
I see us humans and AI systems as really the same

1030
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:25,040
and AI systems ultimately as something

1031
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,160
that supersedes humans.

1032
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:28,640
So what is intelligence?

1033
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:36,800
So in the context of our current discussion,

1034
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:41,120
I think intelligence is very closely linked

1035
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:45,360
to this notion of ideas.

1036
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:48,600
And it's the ability to generate ideas,

1037
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:53,600
to mold ideas, to compress seeming chaos

1038
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:57,960
into some model, into some theory

1039
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:00,680
that efficiently compresses the chaos

1040
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:04,160
in a way where you can then integrate it with other ideas

1041
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:06,400
and they can play and all those kinds of things.

1042
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:11,160
So in that sense, it's the turning chaos into order.

1043
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:15,080
It's the molding of ideas such that our human brains

1044
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:17,160
can work with it.

1045
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:18,920
And it just, from my perspective,

1046
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:22,240
I don't see any reason why they cannot be algorithmatized,

1047
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:25,640
just converted into computational systems.

1048
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:27,280
I would agree.

1049
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:28,280
Which is scary.

1050
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:33,480
Scary or potentially really promising, right?

1051
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:34,880
It's kind of the case of all novelty.

1052
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:37,240
It's terrifying as much as it is promising.

1053
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:39,520
That's why you're pursuing it so heavily.

1054
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:42,600
I would maybe take it a step further

1055
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:44,800
and say that intelligence,

1056
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:48,320
in maybe its most simplistic form is error correction.

1057
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:53,320
So we, humans have wants.

1058
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:56,320
Again, we're constantly expressing our value through action.

1059
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:58,040
There's no other way to express it, by the way.

1060
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:00,440
It's whatever you choose to do in any moment,

1061
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:02,320
you are expressing the values you hold

1062
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:03,720
in your mind and your heart.

1063
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:09,640
As we move from less valued A to more valued B,

1064
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:16,200
entropy happens, uncertainty happens, we fall off course.

1065
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:19,360
And it is intelligence that enables us

1066
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:21,720
to render information from that experience

1067
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:23,760
and error correct, right?

1068
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,960
So that we can move slightly,

1069
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:29,160
shift our trajectory slightly more towards B

1070
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:30,920
that we're trying to move towards.

1071
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:35,640
So I think that there's something there

1072
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:40,640
that I don't know that we can make synthetically.

1073
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:45,840
And that if we define intelligence as error correction,

1074
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:47,520
it's like error correction to what?

1075
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:50,640
Error correction towards what we find is valuable.

1076
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,560
So we're trying to satisfy human wants.

1077
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:54,240
Might not just be our own, could be others as well.

1078
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:55,080
If I'm an entrepreneur,

1079
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:57,560
I'm trying to solve the wants of others, not just myself.

1080
00:49:57,560 --> 00:50:00,400
And I'm trying to error correct myself towards that goal,

1081
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:04,680
using intelligence and processing environmental feedback

1082
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:06,560
through intelligence to error correct.

1083
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:08,040
So I don't know how,

1084
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:12,440
if you eliminate the human element completely,

1085
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:13,960
who's doing the wanting, right?

1086
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:15,320
Where does the value come from?

1087
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:18,160
I know the machine learning people who are listening

1088
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:20,200
are saying that's exactly what machine learning is,

1089
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:21,440
which is error correction

1090
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:24,000
because you have a loss function, objective function

1091
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,280
that measures how wrong your thing is

1092
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:30,200
and you wanna make it less wrong next time.

1093
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:32,000
That's the whole process of machine learning.

1094
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,520
But you're saying what humans are able to do

1095
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:40,520
is in a world where there's no maybe objective values,

1096
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:44,520
absolute values, you're generating that very loss function,

1097
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:46,560
that objective function that you're,

1098
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:49,280
that function that measures the error

1099
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,560
comes from the human mind.

1100
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:55,240
Some aliens might disagree with you

1101
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:58,040
because they might have a different objective function.

1102
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:00,800
But the purpose comes from consciousness, I think.

1103
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:03,560
And without purpose, there's not error correction.

1104
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:06,040
Yeah, I mean, this is again, a hypothesis,

1105
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:07,640
like where does purpose come from?

1106
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:09,440
It seems to come from the mind.

1107
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,840
It seems to come from consciousness, you're right.

1108
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:15,040
That's where suffering comes from

1109
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:16,960
and you want to lessen suffering.

1110
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:20,000
That's where pleasure comes from.

1111
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,800
It seems like it's consciousness.

1112
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:25,080
Maybe there is something to this biological meat bag.

1113
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:27,240
So to take it one layer deeper on this,

1114
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:29,040
and the reason I like this book so much,

1115
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,640
again, The Case Against Reality.

1116
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:33,520
So he's making the case that space and time

1117
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:35,120
are not fundamental.

1118
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:35,960
Yes.

1119
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:38,600
Which I started my intellectual explorations

1120
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:40,120
in physics, actually astrophysics.

1121
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:42,600
So for the longest time, even the way I describe money

1122
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,800
as I talk about space and time.

1123
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,480
So that blew my mind.

1124
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:49,880
But this dovetailed nicely with another book called Leela.

1125
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:53,320
The author is Robert Persig.

1126
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:55,520
So he wrote Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance,

1127
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,200
which is a very popular book.

1128
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,680
20 years later, he wrote Leela,

1129
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:01,320
which no one's heard of, which is crazy.

1130
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:03,840
And he basically says he was wrong about his first book.

1131
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:08,360
And he lays out this entire other metaphysics of quality.

1132
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:09,200
He calls it.

1133
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:10,160
So it's the metaphysics.

1134
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,440
I think it's metaphysics of quality.

1135
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:17,440
But his supposition is that it's not physical reality

1136
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:19,000
that's fundamental.

1137
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,200
It's not informational information that's fundamental.

1138
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:23,200
It's value.

1139
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:26,920
So he actually, and it's a beautiful book.

1140
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:29,160
I highly recommend it.

1141
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:33,120
He essentially is refuting causality itself.

1142
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:34,920
We think A causes B.

1143
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:39,920
This book makes the case that B values precondition A

1144
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:46,000
so that we are actually creating our future

1145
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,480
through our value systems.

1146
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:50,960
And this goes back to something,

1147
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,280
I think Solzhenitsyn said this,

1148
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:54,320
that the line between good and evil

1149
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:56,240
runs down the heart of every man.

1150
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:58,960
So it's as if our moral decisions

1151
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:01,560
are actually what's creating the outcomes

1152
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:03,320
in reality over time.

1153
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:05,600
And then that gets into all the wisdom traditions

1154
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:06,720
related to religion,

1155
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:10,240
where it's always talking about loving thy neighbor

1156
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:12,440
and loving God and all of these other things

1157
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:15,320
that are good morally to create the best outcomes.

1158
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:17,920
So values are fundamental.

1159
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:19,320
Value, yes.

1160
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:21,400
Value is fundamental.

1161
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,200
Oh boy, yeah, that's interesting.

1162
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,200
It does feel like physics is not capturing something.

1163
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:35,200
There's some people, panpsychists argue

1164
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:38,280
that consciousness might be one of the fundamental

1165
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:39,600
properties of nature,

1166
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:42,800
like from which emerges everything we see.

1167
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:46,440
So that could be just other words

1168
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:49,400
for this same notion of value.

1169
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:51,720
And then the basic laws of physics

1170
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:54,040
are not capturing that currently.

1171
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:56,520
So maybe humans, in order to understand

1172
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:57,840
from where humans came from,

1173
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:00,600
we have to understand these other properties of nature,

1174
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:03,520
which are yet to be discovered at the physics level.

1175
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:08,160
And we contend with that underlying nature,

1176
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:10,800
whatever it is, with the logos, right?

1177
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:15,800
So we're looking at uncategorized nature

1178
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:18,560
and then we're assigning a word to it.

1179
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:23,320
So we're slicing up chaos into little boxes of order.

1180
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:25,760
And then we're establishing this social consensus

1181
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:28,920
as to those labels, which we'd call words.

1182
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:30,840
And we're using that to communicate.

1183
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:32,200
And when we communicate,

1184
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:35,280
we can start to build these other things.

1185
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:38,040
This is like the Yuval Harari imagined orders.

1186
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:41,120
So we can create these useful fictions, right?

1187
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:44,080
Whether it's the nation state or human rights or money.

1188
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:48,600
And that allows us to cooperate flexibly in large numbers

1189
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:50,520
so that we can better contend with reality.

1190
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:53,760
We can produce more complicated things.

1191
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:58,400
We can enlarge that bubble of civilization against entropy.

1192
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:01,120
And that's what capitalism is all about.

1193
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:04,560
It's about further specializing knowledge,

1194
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:07,520
further enriching mankind's treasury of knowledge

1195
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:09,600
and doing it.

1196
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:14,280
But to do that, the communication media that we're using,

1197
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:16,800
the words have to have stable meaning.

1198
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:21,560
The money needs to have value that's dependable, right?

1199
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:24,280
It needs to be something that's,

1200
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:26,960
it's not dictated by any one group.

1201
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:30,680
It's reached by consensus of the entire group.

1202
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:35,600
That's how, so you could think it's like optimizing

1203
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:36,800
for error correction again,

1204
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:40,000
where a free market would be harnessing the intelligence

1205
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,880
of all market actors and a central planning

1206
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:46,040
or essentially planned market would be harnessing

1207
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:49,880
just the intelligence of a small group of bureaucrats.

1208
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:51,640
And it's not obvious how to achieve this kind

1209
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:53,480
of consensus mechanism.

1210
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:56,800
I mean, there's obviously we'll talk about sort of Bitcoin

1211
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:57,920
as an idea.

1212
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:01,920
Ultimately, the idea of Bitcoin is connecting it to physics.

1213
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:07,760
So like you can trust that physical matter won't change,

1214
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:12,960
but there could be other ideas that we get.

1215
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:14,720
Maybe physics could be changed.

1216
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:17,480
If Eric Weinstein has anything to say about it.

1217
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:20,560
Like it's, we right now believe that physics

1218
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:23,200
can't be changed, the physical matter of the world,

1219
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,720
but maybe it can in a way that we're totally

1220
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:26,560
not understanding.

1221
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:28,480
You mentioned sort of reality

1222
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:32,520
from Donald Hoffman's perspective.

1223
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:35,480
Like if we don't have even close to direct access

1224
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:38,200
to the fabric of reality,

1225
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:40,780
maybe we're living in a world that's very

1226
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:43,640
like many dimensions that the notions of space

1227
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:46,560
and time is just like a silly, useful construct.

1228
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:48,520
It's not at all connected.

1229
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:51,080
You're starting to look at like Stephen Wolfram's,

1230
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:53,560
I don't know if you're familiar with this view

1231
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:57,200
of the world that it's like hypergraphs underneath it all,

1232
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:58,880
like these mathematical structures from

1233
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:00,520
which everything emerges.

1234
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:05,520
Like they're like many, many, many orders of magnitude

1235
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:11,160
smaller than what we think of as they're even smaller

1236
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:13,280
than like strings and string theory.

1237
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:15,340
So like those are the basic mathematical objects

1238
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:16,600
from which it emerges.

1239
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,640
I don't, I think that's an interesting

1240
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:20,600
philosophical framework.

1241
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:25,400
It's also, people should check out a cool way to play

1242
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,760
with beautiful hypergraph mathematical structures.

1243
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:30,120
So he has, I don't know if you know who Stephen Wolfram is,

1244
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:34,320
but he created Wolfram Alpha and all these tools

1245
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:36,440
that you can actually visualize and play with.

1246
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:39,360
So you can play with physics in a visual way,

1247
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:43,600
which or at least discrete mathematics,

1248
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:45,120
which I think is incredible.

1249
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:46,880
He doesn't get enough love.

1250
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:50,500
One of the reasons he, I think doesn't get enough love

1251
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:53,440
is because of this little quirk of human nature,

1252
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:54,840
which is the ego.

1253
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:59,920
And he sometimes frustrates a few folks

1254
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:04,040
because he's very, let's say proud of his work.

1255
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:04,880
I guess.

1256
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:10,460
But it's interesting to think about a world

1257
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:13,640
where we don't have direct access to reality

1258
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:15,040
as Hoffman argues.

1259
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:17,360
And maybe, I don't know if you can comment,

1260
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:19,400
I don't know if you're familiar with Ayn Rand's work

1261
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:22,000
and her whole philosophy of objectivism

1262
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:27,000
or her whole contention is that we do have access.

1263
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:30,560
I don't wanna misstate it, but at least

1264
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:37,560
she would claim that it's not useful

1265
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:41,600
or I think she would probably say it's not correct

1266
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:44,240
to argue that we don't have access to reality.

1267
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:46,080
We have the hence objectivism.

1268
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:49,140
We have direct access to reality.

1269
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:52,400
That's the only thing we can reason about.

1270
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:55,120
And the only way to live life morally

1271
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:57,760
is to reason through everything,

1272
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:59,600
starting with the axioms of reality,

1273
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:02,080
which we do have direct access to.

1274
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:04,600
You have thoughts about her work?

1275
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:08,920
I am slightly ashamed to say I have not read Ayn Rand yet.

1276
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:10,500
So she is high on my list

1277
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:13,300
and she's been recommended a number of times.

1278
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:16,280
So I don't know a lot specifically

1279
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:18,280
about her philosophy or objectivism,

1280
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:21,640
but to me, it resonates closely

1281
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:25,760
with what the American pragmatist commented on truth.

1282
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:29,720
And they distinguished what you could say is absolute truth,

1283
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:31,300
which is at the bottom of reality,

1284
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:34,320
whether it's Mr. Wolfram's mathematical formulas or value,

1285
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:37,000
whatever it may be, it's something ineffable,

1286
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:41,420
something beyond the reach of epistemology, perhaps even.

1287
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:45,560
And maybe that's why religion just sort of points to it.

1288
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:46,740
It's trying to use,

1289
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:50,680
I think Joseph Campbell said something like,

1290
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:55,680
religion is using stories

1291
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:58,460
to point towards the same transcendental mystery

1292
00:59:58,460 --> 01:00:01,240
we all experience but cannot articulate.

1293
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:03,200
So something like the artist,

1294
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:06,840
the artist uses lies to point to the truth.

1295
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:09,000
Something like that, that kind of thing.

1296
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:11,000
That's really good.

1297
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,740
But the American pragmatist said that,

1298
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:16,320
because at the end of the day, this is all about,

1299
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:17,680
when we say truth,

1300
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:22,680
we need something that is close to social consensus

1301
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:26,040
and is not shakable by political action.

1302
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:28,440
So that's what physics and mathematics are.

1303
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:33,440
It's an unshakable point of reference, I guess you might say.

1304
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:37,560
So, the American pragmatist has defined truth

1305
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:39,480
as the end of inquiry.

1306
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:45,680
And in markets, we could say that the market itself

1307
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:48,800
is a forum that generates truth.

1308
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:50,080
We call this pragmatic truth

1309
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:52,040
to separate pure objective truth

1310
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:54,760
that we can't even talk about without polluting it

1311
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:57,600
versus pragmatic truth, which is something that's useful.

1312
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:00,120
So the example here would be,

1313
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:01,560
if I give you a map,

1314
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:04,640
and you're trying to go from your house

1315
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:07,120
to the local brisket restaurant,

1316
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:08,720
and the map gets you from your house

1317
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:10,480
to the brisket restaurant,

1318
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:11,920
is that because the map is true

1319
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:13,720
or is that because the map is useful?

1320
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:16,480
They're very hard to disentangle

1321
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:18,680
when you're just looking at it pragmatically.

1322
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:21,200
And in markets,

1323
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:24,400
markets, I argue, generate three forms of pragmatic truth.

1324
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:26,560
One is the price.

1325
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:30,600
So this is the collective truth

1326
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:33,320
collective subjective demand

1327
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:35,720
and purchasing power of humanity

1328
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:39,720
running up against the objective supply of capital

1329
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:41,680
and resources in the marketplace.

1330
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:44,240
So there's demand overlaid on supply.

1331
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:45,920
The result of that is the price.

1332
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:50,920
So that is the most truthful exchange ratio,

1333
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:54,040
which is the closest approximation to the value

1334
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:55,960
of any good in the marketplace.

1335
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:58,520
So it gives us a data point on which we can operate.

1336
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:01,320
It's compressing all known market realities

1337
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:03,760
down into a single actionable number.

1338
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:05,840
You know, based on the price of bread or copper,

1339
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:07,440
whether you wanna buy more of it,

1340
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:08,920
you wanna abstain from buying it,

1341
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:11,280
or maybe you wanna try and find substitutes.

1342
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:13,840
And you can think of that price signal,

1343
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:15,480
it's like an economic nerve signal

1344
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:17,520
that's coordinating human action across time.

1345
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:22,520
So if we're one socioeconomic superorganism or collective,

1346
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:24,520
that the price signal is the nerve.

1347
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:26,960
And that's the first form of pragmatic truth

1348
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:28,360
that markets generate.

1349
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:32,200
The second form would be tools and innovations themselves.

1350
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:35,600
So entrepreneurs are experimenting across time.

1351
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:37,600
They're trying to satisfy the wants of consumers.

1352
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:40,440
Consumers are sovereign in the marketplace.

1353
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:43,840
Whatever the consumer wants, the consumer gets, right?

1354
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:44,880
I'm trying to satisfy that.

1355
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:46,360
I'm trying to do it at a profit.

1356
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:49,640
So I'm trying to take viewing the existing price signals

1357
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:50,600
of goods in the marketplace.

1358
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:53,160
I'm trying to assemble those in a way

1359
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:55,680
at a cost lower than the final solution

1360
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:57,320
I'm delivering to my customer.

1361
01:02:57,320 --> 01:02:58,640
I'm selling it at a price higher

1362
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:01,280
than the productive factors I combined to create it.

1363
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:05,040
And in that iterative process,

1364
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:08,920
we're constantly discovering new and better ways

1365
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:11,360
of solving problems or satisfying wants.

1366
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:14,840
So we could say to go out and dig a hole, right?

1367
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:16,480
Someone wants a hole dug,

1368
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:20,200
that a shovel is gonna let you do it much faster per hour

1369
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:22,360
than you would with your bare hands.

1370
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:24,840
So what is the pragmatic truth of digging holes?

1371
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:27,360
It's a shovel, right?

1372
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:29,960
It's the best way we know how to solve

1373
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:31,600
any particular problem

1374
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:35,280
based on the existing treasury of knowledge.

1375
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:39,080
So every tool, again, we're back to ideas being fundamental.

1376
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:42,920
The shovel itself is just a knowledge structure.

1377
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:45,560
We've figured out a way to create this particular implement

1378
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:47,720
and then we've indexed the raw materials

1379
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:49,920
we found in nature to this knowledge structure

1380
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:51,160
to create a shovel,

1381
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:54,760
which allows us to better satisfy human wants

1382
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:57,280
faster, cheaper, better, effectively.

1383
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:59,480
I'm trying to generalize,

1384
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:01,200
you're blowing my mind a little bit here.

1385
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:03,680
I'm trying to generalize the idea of tool

1386
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:04,800
to how to think about it.

1387
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:07,800
Cause I keep just, when you say tool,

1388
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:09,560
I keep imagining different tools,

1389
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:12,240
like specific instantiations of a tool.

1390
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:16,120
I'm trying to see, so the price is a pragmatic truth

1391
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:21,800
that's communicating value in this network.

1392
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:26,680
Subjective demands against objective supply.

1393
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:27,520
Subjective.

1394
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:29,320
So it's an economic democracy.

1395
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:30,160
Got it.

1396
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:32,320
So that's the demand supply.

1397
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:35,520
And then the tools are the ways of extracting

1398
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:39,560
or solving problems is the more general kind of thing.

1399
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:40,920
Or satisfying wants.

1400
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:42,800
Satisfying wants.

1401
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:45,520
So wants are somehow,

1402
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:48,120
that's part of the supply and the demand.

1403
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:49,960
And wants are back to value, right?

1404
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:53,280
Cause everything someone wants are expressing their value.

1405
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:54,120
Okay. Yeah.

1406
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:57,520
So the shovel is a pragmatic truth.

1407
01:04:57,520 --> 01:04:58,920
The shovel is truth.

1408
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:00,640
It feels like a good book title.

1409
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:01,480
Okay, sorry.

1410
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:03,320
So what other pragma, what is the third one?

1411
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:08,320
And then the third one I would argue is virtue actually.

1412
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:09,800
Oh wow.

1413
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:13,400
And another way to maybe think about this

1414
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:14,760
is competitive competency,

1415
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:17,200
but it's also cooperative competency.

1416
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:19,360
So we're learning over time

1417
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:23,480
what characteristics, what patterns of action,

1418
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:26,040
what mindsets, what mental tools,

1419
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:28,000
what heuristics are most useful

1420
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,680
to satisfying customer wants.

1421
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:32,800
So I think that becomes over time,

1422
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:34,400
becomes sharpened into virtue, right?

1423
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:36,520
Like we know it's best to be honest

1424
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:39,360
because if you lie, it's very energy inefficient, right?

1425
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:41,720
You're creating this little fork of reality.

1426
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:43,480
And then if someone else asks you about that lie again,

1427
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:46,160
you have to put another layer of lies on top of it.

1428
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:47,240
Where if you just tell the truth,

1429
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:49,320
you're just recollecting what happened.

1430
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:50,880
And so that sort of keeps,

1431
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:55,640
again, when we're talking about delaying volatility, right?

1432
01:05:55,640 --> 01:05:59,240
If you lie, you're delaying short-term volatility,

1433
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:00,880
but you're increasing long-term volatility.

1434
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:01,720
What about murder?

1435
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:04,160
I haven't been able to figure out why murder is bad

1436
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:07,160
because I just keep wanting to murder people.

1437
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:08,320
And I've murdered many.

1438
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:10,600
You should see someone for that.

1439
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:11,840
Well, that's why I'm trying to get an interview

1440
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:13,400
with Vladimir Putin.

1441
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:17,000
So that's fascinating, virtue in this market

1442
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,760
with the supplies and demands, and there's the tools,

1443
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:23,320
which is also a pragmatic truth, and there's virtue.

1444
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:25,000
It's a pragmatic truth.

1445
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:28,240
Yeah, and if we interfere with that free market process,

1446
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:31,360
again, if we overstep, which this maybe ties into murder,

1447
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:35,080
if you start to be coercive against life, liberty,

1448
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:38,920
or property, so if you're forcibly taking someone's life,

1449
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:41,400
you're breaking down the trust in that market

1450
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:44,120
that generates these pragmatic truths.

1451
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:46,960
If you forcibly infringe on someone's liberty,

1452
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:51,960
right, for any reason other than them originally breaking

1453
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:55,120
or infringing on life, liberty, or property,

1454
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:56,920
then that's not gonna work either.

1455
01:06:56,920 --> 01:06:59,400
And then if you violate private property rights,

1456
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:01,200
if you steal property from others,

1457
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:04,400
you're breaking down the trust

1458
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:08,840
that the intersubjective fabric of money and markets

1459
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:11,200
and the rule of law, all of these useful fictions

1460
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:13,400
are meant to preserve, you're corrupting it

1461
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:14,840
and breaking it down.

1462
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:16,560
What's kind of interesting to think about the market

1463
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:21,560
as helping evolve the virtues, it's sharpened into virtues.

1464
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:24,760
And then these virtues can then go

1465
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:28,720
into motivational posters or like in books

1466
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:32,800
that we all agree on and then eventually take for granted

1467
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:35,400
as if they were somehow fundamental to human nature,

1468
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:37,760
but they're not perhaps fundamental,

1469
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:39,480
they're just pragmatic truths.

1470
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:45,520
Yeah, it's another way to consider competition itself

1471
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:48,280
is that it is a discovery process.

1472
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:52,560
So, you know, entrepreneurs are competing with one another

1473
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:56,360
and they're trying to best satisfy consumer wants

1474
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:57,600
at the lowest possible price.

1475
01:07:57,600 --> 01:08:00,400
So they're placing bets of time, energy and capital

1476
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:03,640
on themselves, on their idea, their business plan.

1477
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:06,320
And then the market decides, right?

1478
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:08,920
The collect, the consensus of market actors decide

1479
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:11,680
which one was better, one lives, one dies.

1480
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:16,680
So competition itself is helping us get closer to truth,

1481
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:18,040
to pragmatic truth.

1482
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:21,360
So we're discovering what is the right price for this asset.

1483
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:24,440
And that price, by the way, it's derived again

1484
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:26,480
in the sense of data compression.

1485
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:28,920
Everyone in the world can see that price.

1486
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:31,560
Everyone in the world can then put their skin in the game

1487
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:34,280
by choosing to buy or sell or short or go long

1488
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:37,360
or do any number of financial actions on that price.

1489
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:40,400
And that information is then propagated back out

1490
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:41,240
to everyone else.

1491
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:45,000
So it's this feedback loop between market actor and price

1492
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:48,160
that makes it so useful.

1493
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:52,560
And that's what carries us,

1494
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:56,120
so it's these collisions of interest that carry us,

1495
01:08:56,120 --> 01:09:00,920
it removes the unuseful aspects of ourselves

1496
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:02,960
or of our tools or of a price

1497
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:05,480
and reveals pragmatic truth to us.

1498
01:09:05,480 --> 01:09:08,280
Can you play my therapist for a second?

1499
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:11,360
And if we talk about creative destruction,

1500
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:13,400
I think, not Bukowski,

1501
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:17,480
Hunter S. Thompson has a quote,

1502
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:20,960
something like, for all instances of beauty,

1503
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:22,880
many souls must be trampled.

1504
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:24,920
Wow.

1505
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:32,280
But there does seem to be an aspect of competition

1506
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:36,480
that destroys, you were talking about entrepreneurs

1507
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:40,600
sort of on the outside of the circle of order,

1508
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:42,600
striving to make sense,

1509
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:47,600
to compress volatility of the chaos of the universe.

1510
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:53,480
Is there some way to protect a little bit

1511
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:55,440
against the pain of that destruction,

1512
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:57,160
of that creative destruction,

1513
01:09:57,160 --> 01:10:00,400
that entrepreneur screaming on fire

1514
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:03,720
as he enlightens the rest of us,

1515
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:06,800
is there some role for us humans together

1516
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:08,320
in the togetherness of it?

1517
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:15,120
Also government, but any kind of collectives

1518
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:18,280
in helping that entrepreneur who's on fire

1519
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:22,920
to maybe after a few minutes to spray him with some water

1520
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:25,160
and put him out of his misery.

1521
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:34,160
I would say that pain is the inarguable basis of being.

1522
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:39,960
Pain is, no matter how you try to explain it away

1523
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:41,440
or describe it,

1524
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:46,440
or it's not something you can rationalize away.

1525
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:50,720
No one, I think ever,

1526
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:52,360
like someone may want to cut themselves

1527
01:10:52,360 --> 01:10:53,280
to have an endorphin high,

1528
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:55,120
but no one wants to suffer, we'd say.

1529
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:57,040
So pain in that sense,

1530
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:59,680
it is what we're constantly trying to deal with

1531
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:03,520
and to move away from,

1532
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:05,960
or create buffers between us and potential pain

1533
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:07,720
or potential uncertainty.

1534
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:11,920
And that pain is information.

1535
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:15,160
When we experience something that is misfit

1536
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:17,120
to the outcome we desired,

1537
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:18,720
that pain is what puts us,

1538
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:21,840
it encourages us to change our trajectory,

1539
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:25,040
to get back on course towards our valued aim.

1540
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:28,640
So as far as, you know,

1541
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:31,960
you need entrepreneurs that are exploring

1542
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:33,280
and you're trying to do something new.

1543
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:34,760
If you're a pioneer of any kind,

1544
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:37,080
you are courageously facing pain.

1545
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:38,960
You're willfully confronting it.

1546
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:41,760
So I don't think it's avoidable in that sense.

1547
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:45,360
It's not like we can have pain free economic growth,

1548
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:48,840
like the central bank would maybe have us lend to believe

1549
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:51,040
that we can just run these experiments

1550
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:51,880
and when they fail,

1551
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:53,720
we'll just paper over all the losses and continue.

1552
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:56,920
Or you're just delaying and exacerbating

1553
01:11:56,920 --> 01:11:59,040
the inevitable volatility back to reality.

1554
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:03,400
But what I would say is that capitalism,

1555
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:04,600
because we're building,

1556
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:07,400
we're increasing the capital stock of the world,

1557
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:09,880
which again, capital is the mitigation of risk.

1558
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:12,240
So we're reducing the overall risk of existence

1559
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:14,400
by accumulating more capital in the world.

1560
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:16,800
And that's what protects that entrepreneur

1561
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:19,480
that's deciding, hey, I saved up a million bucks.

1562
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:21,920
I'm gonna go try this business idea.

1563
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:24,160
I'm gonna put all my money on the line.

1564
01:12:24,160 --> 01:12:26,280
And if he goes up in flames,

1565
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:29,000
then his cost of living when he comes back to reality

1566
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,160
and he's starting over from zero,

1567
01:12:30,160 --> 01:12:32,880
his cost of living is substantially lower

1568
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:33,840
starting over from zero

1569
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:37,040
than he would be out in the wilderness on his own.

1570
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:40,040
So it's the accumulation of capital stock

1571
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:43,320
is the buffer against uncertainty for everyone.

1572
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:47,080
And it gives you actually more potential

1573
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:48,440
to go out and experiment,

1574
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:51,200
to go out and confront the chaos of nature

1575
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:53,960
because you are better healed effectively.

1576
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,520
So I think we're speaking

1577
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:03,120
in sort of idealistic terms about the power of capitalism

1578
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:04,760
when it works well.

1579
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:07,080
Is there any aspects that you think

1580
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:10,560
that don't work well in a free market

1581
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:12,480
in all the basic pragmatic truths

1582
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:13,640
that we were talking about?

1583
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:15,560
Is there ways it can go wrong?

1584
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:20,560
So, I would first argue that we have never seen

1585
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:24,120
an actual purely free market.

1586
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:29,480
Closest example would be,

1587
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:34,440
you know, kind of geopolitically we have a free market

1588
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:37,440
and that governments are not necessarily governed.

1589
01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:43,200
But they are premised on

1590
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:47,520
governing large groups of individuals.

1591
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:49,960
So that's not, doesn't exactly.

1592
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:52,120
You mean between governments?

1593
01:13:52,120 --> 01:13:53,160
Yes.

1594
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:54,640
See, but isn't there still,

1595
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:57,760
so a free market, maybe you can correct me,

1596
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:00,440
is the free market still grounded in the ideas

1597
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:04,000
of property rights and all those kinds of things, right?

1598
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,280
So governments tend to also sometimes

1599
01:14:06,280 --> 01:14:07,840
be violent towards each other.

1600
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:08,680
That's right.

1601
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:11,840
So they don't respect all the basic aspects of capitalism.

1602
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:12,680
That's right.

1603
01:14:12,680 --> 01:14:15,040
So maybe another way to look at this is that

1604
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:20,040
gold is the original governor of government, actually.

1605
01:14:20,840 --> 01:14:24,120
And this is the reason governments have abused

1606
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:26,960
and gone off of the gold standard.

1607
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:31,960
So historically, if you are a bank or a nation state

1608
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:37,840
and you produce more currency

1609
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:40,080
than your gold reserves can justify,

1610
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:43,840
then people, then gold will flow out of your bank

1611
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:44,960
or out of your country.

1612
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:46,800
So there's this natural check

1613
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:51,680
via the money that,

1614
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:54,320
via capitalistic money, which is gold, right?

1615
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:56,040
Gold was selected by the free market.

1616
01:14:56,040 --> 01:14:58,360
It's not decreed by government.

1617
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:02,480
It provided this natural check on government action.

1618
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:07,480
So my, I guess to get back to the original question is

1619
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:11,520
we've never seen a pure free market

1620
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:14,520
because money has always been monopolized

1621
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,920
and coerced, frankly.

1622
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:21,840
So to try and answer what goes wrong with a free market

1623
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:24,640
is really difficult because we've never actually seen it.

1624
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:28,720
And I would define free market is one

1625
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:31,640
in which government only protects life, liberty,

1626
01:15:31,640 --> 01:15:32,640
and property.

1627
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:35,920
And so that has a very minimal role in society.

1628
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:38,320
Again, just as network security

1629
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:40,800
for the economic trade network.

1630
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:44,480
And anything that, any government function

1631
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:47,320
that goes beyond those three core functions,

1632
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:49,280
which by the way are pretty much the core tenets

1633
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:50,400
of morality as well.

1634
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:53,000
So government's just really intended to preserve

1635
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:55,960
natural law, if you will.

1636
01:15:55,960 --> 01:15:58,920
Anything that goes beyond that is,

1637
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:01,480
moves us closer to an unfree market.

1638
01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:06,160
So every regulation, every act of coercion

1639
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:11,160
is actually a gradation closer to a purely unfree market,

1640
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:13,160
which would be a monopoly.

1641
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:15,920
So in terms of what I guess theoretically

1642
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:17,880
we could say goes wrong in the free market

1643
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:20,800
is that it's volatile.

1644
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:25,720
It's trading off, it's accepting short-term volatility

1645
01:16:27,080 --> 01:16:29,400
in exchange for less long-run volatility.

1646
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:32,880
And this tends to be the way of nature, by the way.

1647
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:37,880
So if we look at something like there's a region

1648
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:40,880
in North America called Baja, California,

1649
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:43,720
and it runs into the United States

1650
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:45,480
and it runs down into Mexico as well.

1651
01:16:45,480 --> 01:16:49,440
So the same topology, but two different jurisdictions.

1652
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:55,440
In the US, we very heavily manage forest fires.

1653
01:16:55,680 --> 01:16:57,960
We're trying to manage nature effectively.

1654
01:16:57,960 --> 01:17:00,040
Whereas in Mexico is much more unregulated.

1655
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:04,320
It just, when wildfires spring up, they let them burn off.

1656
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:06,280
North America, when wildfires spring up,

1657
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:08,240
we're actually extinguishing them.

1658
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:09,720
So we're constantly trying to dampen

1659
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:12,320
the short-run volatility of these small brush fires.

1660
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:13,720
Whereas in Mexico, we just let them burn.

1661
01:17:13,720 --> 01:17:15,600
We let nature do its thing.

1662
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:18,920
The consequence of this is that the wildfires

1663
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:21,320
still occur eventually, but they're much larger

1664
01:17:21,320 --> 01:17:23,200
and much more devastating in North America

1665
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:25,240
where human intervention has occurred

1666
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:30,240
because it's dampening nature's natural corrective mechanism

1667
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:34,680
of clearing this underbrush with these more frequent

1668
01:17:34,680 --> 01:17:38,080
and smaller fires at the cost of much larger fires.

1669
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:39,920
So again, we're delaying short-term volatility

1670
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:42,600
and exacerbating long-run volatility.

1671
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:44,360
And in Mexico, it's the opposite, right?

1672
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:46,520
Just these wildfires burn much smaller

1673
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:49,360
and more continuously over time.

1674
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:51,040
The further effect of that in North America

1675
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:53,200
is that the fires can get so big and so hot

1676
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:55,120
that it burns away the topsoil.

1677
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:58,480
So it actually destroys the fertility of the soil itself.

1678
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:03,000
So the point of this is that human intervention, right?

1679
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:06,600
Even the intention behind North American authorities

1680
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:10,320
managing that forest fire is to create less destruction.

1681
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:11,960
That is the intention.

1682
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:15,360
But the intention is divergent from the outcome.

1683
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:18,960
So in Tlaibian speak, he would say that human intervention

1684
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:23,960
moves us from mediocrestan into extremistan.

1685
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:27,360
So mediocrestan would be something much more like nature

1686
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:30,160
where, for instance, you can't double your body weight

1687
01:18:30,160 --> 01:18:33,720
in a day, probably can't even do it in a year, right?

1688
01:18:33,720 --> 01:18:34,760
But in extremistan,

1689
01:18:34,760 --> 01:18:37,160
which is something much more information-based,

1690
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:41,880
you can double or send your net worth to zero

1691
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:44,760
in a single trade, in a single moment, right?

1692
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:48,640
So when we try and intervene with natural biological systems

1693
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:51,760
that have these feedback loops,

1694
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:53,840
we actually start to push the system more

1695
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:56,280
to behave more like an extremistan system

1696
01:18:57,360 --> 01:18:59,920
that has less short-run volatility

1697
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:03,600
but more extreme long-run volatility.

1698
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:07,120
But the question is where you look at capitalism

1699
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:10,600
or communism, for example, and by the way, yes,

1700
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:13,280
I will talk to somebody who's a Marxist or a communist.

1701
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:16,600
Gretchen Wolf is a pretty eloquent defender of these ideas

1702
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:19,960
because it's always good to really understand ideas

1703
01:19:19,960 --> 01:19:24,120
as opposed to just reject them offhand.

1704
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:26,280
When you look at the system of capitalism

1705
01:19:26,280 --> 01:19:30,960
or the system of communism, there's ideals,

1706
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:34,000
and a lot of people argue in this perfect form

1707
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:35,760
would actually be good for the world.

1708
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:38,600
The question is how resilient are they

1709
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:42,240
to the corruption of human nature?

1710
01:19:42,240 --> 01:19:45,880
And I mean, you're saying that there's never been

1711
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:48,800
a free market, it's a very true statement.

1712
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:52,960
The question is how resilient is capitalism

1713
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:54,720
or whatever implementations of capitalism

1714
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:57,360
we had up to this point to human nature

1715
01:19:57,360 --> 01:19:59,360
where one person will become successful

1716
01:20:01,240 --> 01:20:03,200
through legitimate means,

1717
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:06,080
then starts to try to manipulate the system

1718
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:07,760
that takes it away from a free market

1719
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:11,080
or takes it away from the things

1720
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:14,080
that gave them the riches in the first place,

1721
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:17,400
and then try to, through corruption, get more.

1722
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:20,960
That's the thing you said, the lazy human ways.

1723
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:23,160
Now I try to figure out how to get something for nothing.

1724
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:24,440
That's right.

1725
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:27,080
So how resilient do you think is capitalism to that?

1726
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:31,520
Well, the best implementation we've had of it

1727
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:35,760
really has been the United States, I think,

1728
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:39,680
up until this point, but it's still,

1729
01:20:40,720 --> 01:20:42,480
the central banking itself,

1730
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:45,880
this was in the 1848 Manifesto to the Communist Party.

1731
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:49,800
Measure number five reads an exclusive state monopoly

1732
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:51,920
and centralized control over cash and credit.

1733
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:56,680
So the central bank is a Marxist or communist institution.

1734
01:20:56,680 --> 01:20:58,800
It is antithetical to the free market principles

1735
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:00,640
on which the United States was founded.

1736
01:21:00,640 --> 01:21:02,160
And indeed, the United States resisted

1737
01:21:02,160 --> 01:21:04,520
the implementation of a central bank.

1738
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:06,560
I think it was Andrew Jackson.

1739
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:08,480
I know there was the first national bank,

1740
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:10,880
the second national bank were both disbanded.

1741
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:14,160
And then Andrew Jackson, which is my favorite Tennessean,

1742
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:18,240
he has some famous quotes about routing out the bankers

1743
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:19,760
like a den of vipers.

1744
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:23,120
I think he punched one of the central bankers in the face.

1745
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:27,000
Back when our leaders were a bit more bad-ass,

1746
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,880
I guess you might say.

1747
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:33,880
And finally in 1913, the Federal Reserve was implemented

1748
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:39,520
and it's been kind of all downhill from there.

1749
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:42,000
So what is, can you, oh, sorry, go ahead.

1750
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:45,680
I was just gonna say that communism and capitalism,

1751
01:21:45,680 --> 01:21:47,280
it's also a matter of scale.

1752
01:21:48,760 --> 01:21:51,960
The ideal behind communism is from each according

1753
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:54,160
to their ability to each according to their need.

1754
01:21:54,160 --> 01:21:55,520
Sounds beautiful, right?

1755
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:57,440
Sounds like a great, peaceful,

1756
01:21:57,440 --> 01:22:00,080
harmonious way to organize ourselves.

1757
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:02,760
The problem is, and by the way,

1758
01:22:02,760 --> 01:22:05,560
I am a communist in my family, in my home, right?

1759
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:07,240
At that very smallest of scales.

1760
01:22:07,240 --> 01:22:10,280
Yes, in your very small circles of trust,

1761
01:22:10,280 --> 01:22:14,000
you're much more likely to behave selflessly

1762
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:14,840
towards one another.

1763
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:17,320
By the way, I look forward to the Bitcoin community

1764
01:22:17,320 --> 01:22:20,960
clipping out that part saying that Robert Breedlove

1765
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:24,000
is a communist and the ideals of communism are beautiful.

1766
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,600
Yeah, context matters, people.

1767
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:28,440
Sorry, go ahead.

1768
01:22:29,480 --> 01:22:32,960
But to your point, it does not scale, right?

1769
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:37,920
As we move into this larger system

1770
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:39,720
of socioeconomic cooperation,

1771
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:43,400
which is necessary to deepen the division of labor,

1772
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:44,960
to generate more wealth, right?

1773
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:48,600
We need to interact with one another on much larger scales

1774
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:52,240
than this communistic utopian ideal.

1775
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:54,360
We get into the realm of capitalism

1776
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:58,040
where we need really sound rules, hard rules,

1777
01:22:58,040 --> 01:23:03,040
consensus, verifiability, and frankly, prices.

1778
01:23:03,680 --> 01:23:06,400
Because the other thing in Soviet Russia

1779
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:08,840
is they tried to replace the profit motive

1780
01:23:08,840 --> 01:23:12,440
or the price signal with this devotion

1781
01:23:12,440 --> 01:23:15,440
to this nationalistic faith and devotion.

1782
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:18,360
Where it's like, you don't need self-interest anymore.

1783
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:20,320
You don't need prices or profits.

1784
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:23,240
You can just protect Mother Russia, right?

1785
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:26,440
And serve Mother Russia and that would create wealth.

1786
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:28,080
And what happened, right?

1787
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:29,800
They destroyed price signals.

1788
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:32,200
There were shortages, there were famines.

1789
01:23:32,200 --> 01:23:36,000
There's all levels of corruption.

1790
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:41,000
Because to your point, people have to run the system

1791
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:42,520
no matter what.

1792
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:45,440
So when people are always pursuing something for nothing

1793
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:46,680
and you put someone in a seat

1794
01:23:46,680 --> 01:23:49,240
of much closer to absolute power,

1795
01:23:49,240 --> 01:23:51,400
where they're making all the pricing decisions,

1796
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:54,800
they own all of the productive factors in the economy,

1797
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:57,800
they're not beholden to any market force.

1798
01:23:57,800 --> 01:24:01,680
There's no market check on their action

1799
01:24:01,680 --> 01:24:04,800
that that institution tends to become more corrupt.

1800
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:08,880
And further, it's an inferior resource strategy.

1801
01:24:10,680 --> 01:24:11,720
I alluded to this earlier,

1802
01:24:11,720 --> 01:24:14,720
where the other way to think about free market

1803
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:19,040
versus central planning is it's decentralized

1804
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:21,960
or distributed computing versus centralized computing.

1805
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:26,160
So each one of us, I think that the number

1806
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:29,480
is 120 bits per second of active awareness.

1807
01:24:29,480 --> 01:24:32,280
So we can take in, clearly we process a lot more than that,

1808
01:24:32,280 --> 01:24:35,120
but our active awareness, I think is 120 bits per second.

1809
01:24:37,560 --> 01:24:40,680
In a centralized planning body, like in Soviet Russia,

1810
01:24:40,680 --> 01:24:41,920
they had the pricing czar.

1811
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:44,720
Maybe they had 10, 20,000 people deciding the prices

1812
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:46,120
for the entire country.

1813
01:24:46,120 --> 01:24:48,960
You're only getting that much data throughput, right?

1814
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:52,360
20,000 people times 120 bits per second.

1815
01:24:52,360 --> 01:24:56,160
Whereas in a free market, if everyone is free to interact

1816
01:24:56,160 --> 01:24:59,080
with deep capital markets based on an accurate price,

1817
01:24:59,080 --> 01:25:00,480
you're getting the data throughput

1818
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:04,520
of 120 bits per second times the entire economy, right?

1819
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:08,840
So you're getting, it's a more efficient means

1820
01:25:08,840 --> 01:25:11,840
for disseminating knowledge effectively.

1821
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:14,080
And then again, knowledge is just,

1822
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:17,360
the more knowledge a socioeconomic structure can contain,

1823
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:19,240
the more wealthy it is, right?

1824
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:21,840
Prices, tools, all these things are just knowledge.

1825
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:26,840
So in that respect, that's why something like capitalism,

1826
01:25:26,840 --> 01:25:30,760
even in its marginalized form, state capitalism,

1827
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:33,160
out-competes communism.

1828
01:25:33,160 --> 01:25:36,440
It's distributed computing versus centralized computing.

1829
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:43,200
We kind of brought up religion and Joseph Campbell and myth

1830
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:46,120
and the propagation of ideas.

1831
01:25:46,120 --> 01:25:49,720
And before I forget, I wanted to ask your thoughts

1832
01:25:49,720 --> 01:25:50,560
about this.

1833
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:56,240
Jordan Peterson, I haven't really understood exactly

1834
01:25:56,240 --> 01:25:59,360
be able to pin him down exactly what he sees

1835
01:25:59,360 --> 01:26:03,800
as the role of religion in human society,

1836
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:08,640
but it feels like he's describing it

1837
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:11,440
as having value for us.

1838
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:15,520
This, the ideas of myth are valuable.

1839
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:18,720
They're valuable mechanisms toward,

1840
01:26:18,720 --> 01:26:21,600
I think you mentioned kind of directing us

1841
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:23,880
in this world as a human society.

1842
01:26:23,880 --> 01:26:26,320
Do you think about myth?

1843
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:27,720
Do you think about religion?

1844
01:26:27,720 --> 01:26:32,080
What's the use of it in this construct of markets

1845
01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:37,080
in this framework of where ideas are ultimately

1846
01:26:38,120 --> 01:26:43,120
the fundamental thing that makes societies work?

1847
01:26:44,760 --> 01:26:49,760
Yeah, I think Jordan Peterson, who I'm a huge fan of,

1848
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,120
he's been very influential in my thinking

1849
01:26:52,120 --> 01:26:56,440
and influential on my own religious views as well.

1850
01:26:58,840 --> 01:27:02,840
I think his position would be, and he's said this before,

1851
01:27:02,840 --> 01:27:06,520
that he acts as if God exists.

1852
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:11,120
And I've had some arguments about this before,

1853
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:15,320
but to me that points towards the preeminence of action

1854
01:27:15,320 --> 01:27:16,800
and how important action is

1855
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:20,280
versus your cognitive beliefs necessarily.

1856
01:27:20,280 --> 01:27:23,440
And I think there is a lot of utility in that,

1857
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:25,920
that if you follow the moral code

1858
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:27,360
of something like the Bible,

1859
01:27:28,440 --> 01:27:30,520
you do reap benefits from that,

1860
01:27:30,520 --> 01:27:32,520
society reaps benefits from that.

1861
01:27:34,520 --> 01:27:37,080
And this is not, and sometimes I bring up this point

1862
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:38,600
and people are like, oh my God, are you kidding me?

1863
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:39,760
Have you read the Old Testament?

1864
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:41,680
They're clobbering people with rocks

1865
01:27:41,680 --> 01:27:43,600
when they do the wrong thing.

1866
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:46,600
The Bible doesn't claim to be this,

1867
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:48,560
like do everything that was done in the Bible.

1868
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:50,960
It's more like charting this moral progression

1869
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:53,640
where we came from this very barbaric society

1870
01:27:53,640 --> 01:27:56,080
into something more like the New Testament

1871
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:59,360
where we're honoring individual sovereignty above the state

1872
01:27:59,360 --> 01:28:00,200
and things like that.

1873
01:28:00,200 --> 01:28:04,960
So I think that mythology itself

1874
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:07,480
is another form of data compression.

1875
01:28:07,480 --> 01:28:10,160
If you look at these stories,

1876
01:28:10,160 --> 01:28:11,920
Cain and Abel is a good example,

1877
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:14,960
or Peterson makes the point that it's a tiny story.

1878
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:17,920
It's a paragraph-ish long,

1879
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:20,200
but it contains so many layers of meaning

1880
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:24,720
in regards to violence, to evil, betrayal, work,

1881
01:28:26,640 --> 01:28:29,280
the divergence between intention and result,

1882
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:31,600
because I think Cain is actually making,

1883
01:28:33,160 --> 01:28:36,360
he's making the effort to sacrifice for God,

1884
01:28:36,360 --> 01:28:38,720
but the sacrifices he's making are not,

1885
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:41,160
God doesn't find them useful, right?

1886
01:28:41,160 --> 01:28:43,480
And so he sort of rejects them.

1887
01:28:43,480 --> 01:28:48,480
So for a, again, if we're organized

1888
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:50,480
by these useful fictions, right?

1889
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:53,400
These Hararean imagined orders,

1890
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:56,800
I think mythology is kind of the original version of that,

1891
01:28:56,800 --> 01:29:01,800
where we were learning to organize ourselves around stories

1892
01:29:03,320 --> 01:29:08,320
to best coordinate our action across space and time.

1893
01:29:08,320 --> 01:29:12,840
And so I think it's very foundational,

1894
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:15,400
and back to what we were saying in the beginning,

1895
01:29:15,400 --> 01:29:17,680
that if value truly is fundamental,

1896
01:29:17,680 --> 01:29:20,160
I think it's interesting that all these stories

1897
01:29:20,160 --> 01:29:23,920
point towards often common moral values.

1898
01:29:23,920 --> 01:29:25,680
They're not perfectly aligned,

1899
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:31,520
but it does speak to just the evolutionary importance

1900
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:33,920
of morality and the subjectivity of morality,

1901
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:36,440
where morality sort of evolves over time

1902
01:29:36,440 --> 01:29:40,200
based on, frankly, the capital stock we've accumulated.

1903
01:29:40,200 --> 01:29:41,920
The more capital stock we've accumulated,

1904
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:45,040
the easier life is, the less barbaric we have to be.

1905
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:48,880
Whereas if we're living in conditions of true scarcity,

1906
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:53,520
then we tend to be a bit more barbaric towards one another.

1907
01:29:54,640 --> 01:29:56,560
And that too, to dovetail this

1908
01:29:56,560 --> 01:29:58,760
into something largely unrelated,

1909
01:29:58,760 --> 01:30:01,480
but I think is really important, is inflation.

1910
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:05,560
Inflation, by artificially increasing

1911
01:30:05,560 --> 01:30:08,880
the prices of goods and services in the world,

1912
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:11,480
we're injecting more dollars,

1913
01:30:11,480 --> 01:30:14,440
chasing the same level of goods and services.

1914
01:30:14,440 --> 01:30:17,400
We are artificially increasing scarcity,

1915
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:20,160
perceived scarcity.

1916
01:30:21,160 --> 01:30:24,240
And when you increase perceived scarcity,

1917
01:30:24,240 --> 01:30:27,080
you are amplifying divisiveness.

1918
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:32,720
The natural state of man is when everything is scarce

1919
01:30:32,720 --> 01:30:34,160
and you really have to fight hard

1920
01:30:34,160 --> 01:30:37,120
just to eat or drink water that day.

1921
01:30:37,120 --> 01:30:40,080
So it's de-civilizing in a way

1922
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:42,080
by artificially amplifying

1923
01:30:42,080 --> 01:30:44,120
the perceived scarcity in the world.

1924
01:30:44,120 --> 01:30:46,360
Can you elaborate, how does inflation

1925
01:30:46,360 --> 01:30:48,800
increase the perceived scarcity in the world?

1926
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:52,560
So we could think the price itself is an indication,

1927
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:54,200
it's a data packet, if you will.

1928
01:30:54,200 --> 01:30:57,360
The price is a data packet on supply and demand, right?

1929
01:30:57,360 --> 01:31:00,040
It's telling you how much supply there is

1930
01:31:00,040 --> 01:31:03,120
of something in the world relative to the demand.

1931
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:06,480
So when you print money

1932
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:08,600
and artificially increase that price,

1933
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:10,840
it's diverging away from supply and demand.

1934
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:13,840
It's becoming just more of a product of policy

1935
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:16,200
than it is of free market fundamentals.

1936
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:19,960
The more expensive something is,

1937
01:31:19,960 --> 01:31:21,880
that is a signal to the marketplace

1938
01:31:21,880 --> 01:31:24,720
and to market actors that it is scarce, right?

1939
01:31:24,720 --> 01:31:29,720
That's why a Leonardo painting might sell for $16 million.

1940
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:32,960
There's only one, there's a lot of demand for it.

1941
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:36,000
Maybe my numbers are off, but you get the point.

1942
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,400
It's the reason mask spiked in price

1943
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:39,920
after the COVID announcement, right?

1944
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:41,920
There was not enough supply,

1945
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:43,640
toilet paper, et cetera, et cetera.

1946
01:31:43,640 --> 01:31:47,720
So inflation, and by inflation,

1947
01:31:47,720 --> 01:31:52,240
I specifically mean arbitrary fiat currency supply inflation

1948
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:53,680
by a legal monopoly.

1949
01:31:54,760 --> 01:31:57,360
Inflation is a commonly misunderstood word.

1950
01:31:57,360 --> 01:32:01,400
That is amplifying the perception of scarcity

1951
01:32:01,400 --> 01:32:03,560
among market actors in the world.

1952
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:07,880
And I would argue that it actually amplifies divisiveness.

1953
01:32:07,880 --> 01:32:12,080
I think this is the key maybe to looking at

1954
01:32:12,080 --> 01:32:15,160
the connection between the monopolization of money

1955
01:32:15,160 --> 01:32:17,200
and things like cancel culture,

1956
01:32:17,200 --> 01:32:22,200
because it's increasing our natural predilection

1957
01:32:22,840 --> 01:32:24,360
to be combative with one another,

1958
01:32:24,360 --> 01:32:26,760
because we think there's more scarcity in the world

1959
01:32:26,760 --> 01:32:28,000
than there actually is.

1960
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:29,960
Versus in a world where you're not increasing

1961
01:32:29,960 --> 01:32:33,280
the money supply, prices are declining every year.

1962
01:32:33,280 --> 01:32:36,480
As prices decline, this is a signal to market actors

1963
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:39,080
and the market that scarcity is declining.

1964
01:32:39,080 --> 01:32:42,000
There's less need to fight over things.

1965
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:46,240
And all of this ties back into the old Bastiat saying

1966
01:32:46,240 --> 01:32:50,320
that if goods don't cross borders, soldiers will.

1967
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:52,080
So if we're not trading with one another,

1968
01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:54,000
if we're not acting interdependently

1969
01:32:54,000 --> 01:33:00,160
and we're not becoming more intelligent as a market,

1970
01:33:00,160 --> 01:33:03,840
and that increased intelligence or increased knowledge

1971
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:06,640
is reflected in decreased prices,

1972
01:33:06,640 --> 01:33:11,040
because prices are just the exchange ratios of things.

1973
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:13,000
So the smarter we can solve problems,

1974
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,920
the better we can solve problems, the less prices would be.

1975
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:18,840
So it induces more cooperation.

1976
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:21,680
I love how you tie inflation and cancel culture together

1977
01:33:21,680 --> 01:33:28,400
as essentially artificial creation of increase of conflict.

1978
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:30,440
Increasing, artificially increasing scarcity

1979
01:33:30,440 --> 01:33:33,440
and thereby artificially increasing conflict.

1980
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:35,840
That's really fascinating.

1981
01:33:35,840 --> 01:33:39,040
You're short circuiting my brain many times

1982
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:40,600
throughout this conversation.

1983
01:33:40,600 --> 01:33:45,400
OK, this robot is struggling to keep up.

1984
01:33:45,400 --> 01:33:50,960
OK, maybe to step back at the useful fictions

1985
01:33:50,960 --> 01:33:53,960
or pragmatic truths.

1986
01:33:53,960 --> 01:33:55,760
Let me ask the question that you've

1987
01:33:55,760 --> 01:33:59,240
answered in many ways already, but let's explicitly

1988
01:33:59,240 --> 01:34:02,000
look at what is money?

1989
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
Oh, as you know, that's my favorite question.

1990
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:04,500
Yes.

1991
01:34:04,500 --> 01:34:06,520
Yes.

1992
01:34:06,520 --> 01:34:10,000
That is the name of the show I just launched,

1993
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:13,520
the What Is Money show.

1994
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:17,400
Clearly, we could say that the Bitcoin rabbit hole is what's

1995
01:34:17,400 --> 01:34:22,160
led me to explore a lot of these ideas in depth.

1996
01:34:22,160 --> 01:34:23,920
And I think as we've demonstrated today,

1997
01:34:23,920 --> 01:34:26,720
it goes well beyond just the economic sphere

1998
01:34:26,720 --> 01:34:28,840
when you start to think about things like exchange

1999
01:34:28,840 --> 01:34:33,280
and morality and time preference and civilization.

2000
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:36,040
So I love the question, what is money?

2001
01:34:36,040 --> 01:34:40,000
I think it is the key to incepting a deeper

2002
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:41,640
understanding of the world into people

2003
01:34:41,640 --> 01:34:44,760
that if you actually just start to ask

2004
01:34:44,760 --> 01:34:48,720
the seemingly simple question, it

2005
01:34:48,720 --> 01:34:51,440
surfaces more and more layers of truth.

2006
01:34:51,440 --> 01:34:55,880
And I recently, I just wrote a piece,

2007
01:34:55,880 --> 01:35:00,720
I think I have 30 something answers to this question.

2008
01:35:00,720 --> 01:35:03,440
So sometimes it's actually a more systematic way

2009
01:35:03,440 --> 01:35:06,640
of asking the question of what is the meaning of life.

2010
01:35:06,640 --> 01:35:11,240
There's some questions that are almost unanswerable,

2011
01:35:11,240 --> 01:35:17,680
but in their asking allow you to deeply get closer to truth,

2012
01:35:17,680 --> 01:35:21,560
deeply understand the nature of our human existence.

2013
01:35:21,560 --> 01:35:23,000
And the meaning of life is almost

2014
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:29,040
like this initial philosophers striving towards that.

2015
01:35:29,040 --> 01:35:33,960
If money is indeed as fundamental as you've

2016
01:35:33,960 --> 01:35:36,240
described, especially in the context of value

2017
01:35:36,240 --> 01:35:39,640
being fundamental, then that is a really,

2018
01:35:39,640 --> 01:35:41,960
that's a more, let's take a 21st century way

2019
01:35:41,960 --> 01:35:45,040
of asking the same question about what is the meaning of life.

2020
01:35:45,040 --> 01:35:47,880
You mentioned that it's a meta property out

2021
01:35:47,880 --> 01:35:51,080
of the list of many ways to answer that question.

2022
01:35:51,080 --> 01:35:53,240
How would you help people to think about that?

2023
01:35:53,240 --> 01:35:58,600
Yeah, the first most serious answer

2024
01:35:58,600 --> 01:36:01,440
comes from the School of Austrian Economics

2025
01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:06,520
and it defines money as a universal medium of exchange.

2026
01:36:06,520 --> 01:36:12,480
So this would be any good that is used,

2027
01:36:12,480 --> 01:36:15,120
held and used purely for purposes

2028
01:36:15,120 --> 01:36:17,520
of facilitating exchange.

2029
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:21,520
So in the configuration of demand

2030
01:36:21,520 --> 01:36:24,960
for any particular asset, it's bifurcated

2031
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:27,480
between its utility, which is something,

2032
01:36:27,480 --> 01:36:31,000
a service that it can render to you in real time.

2033
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:35,000
Whether it's, if it's water, you're thirsty.

2034
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:39,080
That's the utility of water is that it can quench your thirst.

2035
01:36:39,080 --> 01:36:41,080
Whereas the marketability would be

2036
01:36:41,080 --> 01:36:43,000
the expectation of future exchange,

2037
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,560
that other people would want this asset in the future

2038
01:36:45,560 --> 01:36:49,080
to trade it for whatever they may have.

2039
01:36:49,080 --> 01:36:52,920
Money is just going to be the good in any trading

2040
01:36:52,920 --> 01:36:56,000
economy that has the highest proportion of marketability

2041
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:57,840
relative to utility.

2042
01:36:57,840 --> 01:37:00,520
So today, that would be gold.

2043
01:37:00,520 --> 01:37:03,400
Gold has utility, it's used in electronics,

2044
01:37:03,400 --> 01:37:06,480
it's used in dental dentistry and whatnot,

2045
01:37:06,480 --> 01:37:09,840
but it's largely used as a store of value across time

2046
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:12,240
and that's what it's been used for for 5,000 years.

2047
01:37:12,240 --> 01:37:16,640
So if we say gold has a $10 trillion market cap,

2048
01:37:16,640 --> 01:37:19,320
maybe $2 trillion of that is its utility value

2049
01:37:19,320 --> 01:37:22,520
or it's actually demand for use in computers and dentistry

2050
01:37:22,520 --> 01:37:24,480
and an $8 trillion of that is demand

2051
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:26,080
for its use as a store of value.

2052
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:30,000
The marketability aspects of money

2053
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:34,160
boils down to five services that money can render.

2054
01:37:34,160 --> 01:37:37,640
Money needs to be divisible, it needs to be durable,

2055
01:37:37,640 --> 01:37:40,120
it needs to be recognizable, it needs to be portable,

2056
01:37:40,120 --> 01:37:43,000
and it needs to be scarce.

2057
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:44,680
So I'll gloss over a lot of history with this

2058
01:37:44,680 --> 01:37:48,240
and just say that historically, money's always

2059
01:37:48,240 --> 01:37:51,080
been a technology, still is a technology or a tool.

2060
01:37:51,080 --> 01:37:52,600
I use these terms interchangeably

2061
01:37:52,600 --> 01:37:54,840
and if you think about it, it's a tool.

2062
01:37:54,840 --> 01:37:57,360
It's a tool interchangeably and if you think of a technology

2063
01:37:57,360 --> 01:37:59,600
as just a more sophisticated tool effectively.

2064
01:38:03,160 --> 01:38:04,520
To best satisfy those properties,

2065
01:38:04,520 --> 01:38:06,160
monetary metals were determined

2066
01:38:06,160 --> 01:38:08,880
to be the most satisfactory tool,

2067
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:10,600
the most divisible, most durable, most recognizable,

2068
01:38:10,600 --> 01:38:13,720
most portable tool in the marketplace.

2069
01:38:13,720 --> 01:38:17,600
Of the monetary metals, gold was the most scarce

2070
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:21,200
as quantified by either its stock to flow ratio

2071
01:38:21,200 --> 01:38:22,840
or its inflation resistance.

2072
01:38:22,840 --> 01:38:25,560
Simple way to say this is that people always prefer

2073
01:38:25,560 --> 01:38:27,920
the money most resistant to inflation.

2074
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:30,720
That's a nice definition of scarcity in the context

2075
01:38:30,720 --> 01:38:33,960
of money is if you were to measure it,

2076
01:38:33,960 --> 01:38:36,120
the resistance to inflation.

2077
01:38:36,120 --> 01:38:38,920
So how hard is it to artificially increase the supply?

2078
01:38:38,920 --> 01:38:39,920
That's right.

2079
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:41,840
That is the hardness of money.

2080
01:38:41,840 --> 01:38:43,360
And that's why gold is hard money.

2081
01:38:43,360 --> 01:38:44,840
Because the alchemy is hard.

2082
01:38:44,840 --> 01:38:46,080
That's right.

2083
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:48,800
Because no one cracked the alchemy, so gold became money.

2084
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:53,800
So that's such a nice, clean explanation

2085
01:38:54,640 --> 01:38:57,280
of what is money with the five elements

2086
01:38:57,280 --> 01:38:59,280
and gold ultimately won out

2087
01:38:59,280 --> 01:39:01,680
because of the last piece of scarcity.

2088
01:39:01,680 --> 01:39:02,520
That's right.

2089
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:04,600
And to get to maybe dig a little deeper there.

2090
01:39:04,600 --> 01:39:08,400
So scarcity, we commonly think of scarcity

2091
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:12,400
as strictly a supply property

2092
01:39:12,400 --> 01:39:15,200
where if there's not much of something, then it's scarce.

2093
01:39:15,200 --> 01:39:16,520
But it's not actually true.

2094
01:39:16,520 --> 01:39:20,720
Scarcity occurs when demand exceeds supply.

2095
01:39:20,720 --> 01:39:24,320
So when there's more demand than the supply can justify,

2096
01:39:24,320 --> 01:39:26,240
the thing becomes an economic good

2097
01:39:26,240 --> 01:39:30,000
and it establishes itself a market price.

2098
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:31,520
So there's more demand for the thing

2099
01:39:31,520 --> 01:39:33,720
than the supply can satisfy.

2100
01:39:33,720 --> 01:39:37,000
The unique thing about money as a concept at least

2101
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:40,720
is that demand always exceeds supply.

2102
01:39:40,720 --> 01:39:43,440
There's never enough money to satisfy everyone, right?

2103
01:39:43,440 --> 01:39:46,320
Because another definition for money,

2104
01:39:46,320 --> 01:39:48,520
it's the most marketable good.

2105
01:39:48,520 --> 01:39:53,000
So it can be traded for any other good service,

2106
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,080
piece of knowledge in the marketplace.

2107
01:39:55,080 --> 01:39:58,160
So humans being what we are, we're never satisfied, right?

2108
01:39:58,160 --> 01:40:01,160
We always want more of something, whatever it may be.

2109
01:40:01,160 --> 01:40:04,920
So money as the ultimate token of obtaining that something

2110
01:40:04,920 --> 01:40:07,200
is always scarce as a concept.

2111
01:40:08,960 --> 01:40:12,520
But the problem with money is that if you can,

2112
01:40:12,520 --> 01:40:15,440
as you alluded to, easily increase its supply,

2113
01:40:15,440 --> 01:40:17,040
then all of a sudden you can compromise

2114
01:40:17,040 --> 01:40:18,520
the scarcity of it over time

2115
01:40:19,960 --> 01:40:22,160
and you can rob people through inflation.

2116
01:40:23,200 --> 01:40:26,560
So that's why the market settled on gold as money.

2117
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:31,480
And robbing is reallocating the value that I,

2118
01:40:31,480 --> 01:40:34,320
so essentially the one property,

2119
01:40:34,320 --> 01:40:37,640
like why scarcity is important

2120
01:40:37,640 --> 01:40:42,520
is it adds a lot more friction to the reallocation.

2121
01:40:42,520 --> 01:40:47,520
Like through essentially violence or implied violence.

2122
01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:51,360
Well, it prevents it through cost of extraction too.

2123
01:40:51,360 --> 01:40:54,440
So if you want to go out and dilute gold holders today,

2124
01:40:54,440 --> 01:40:57,400
you have to go out into the world and mine gold.

2125
01:40:57,400 --> 01:40:59,680
It's a very expensive process.

2126
01:40:59,680 --> 01:41:02,680
That process tends to find equilibrium

2127
01:41:02,680 --> 01:41:05,160
where production cost equals the market value of gold.

2128
01:41:05,160 --> 01:41:08,480
So if market value is $2,000 an ounce today of gold,

2129
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:10,920
its production cost is gonna be around there.

2130
01:41:10,920 --> 01:41:12,360
That's the natural market equilibrium.

2131
01:41:12,360 --> 01:41:16,800
So that way gold miners cannot just dilute people over time.

2132
01:41:16,800 --> 01:41:19,680
Whereas if you look at something like fiat currency,

2133
01:41:19,680 --> 01:41:21,120
which we're jumping ahead a little bit,

2134
01:41:21,120 --> 01:41:23,800
but its production cost is zero.

2135
01:41:23,800 --> 01:41:26,520
So there's a reason the market value of fiat currency

2136
01:41:26,520 --> 01:41:29,480
historically has always converged to zero

2137
01:41:29,480 --> 01:41:31,440
because its production cost is near zero.

2138
01:41:31,440 --> 01:41:34,040
So the extension to that question might be

2139
01:41:34,040 --> 01:41:37,680
how did we get from gold to paper currency?

2140
01:41:37,680 --> 01:41:40,440
And again, this is rooted in the properties of money.

2141
01:41:40,440 --> 01:41:43,440
As good as monetary metals were and as good as gold is

2142
01:41:43,440 --> 01:41:46,680
as money at holding value across time,

2143
01:41:46,680 --> 01:41:49,800
it's rather limited in terms of portability.

2144
01:41:49,800 --> 01:41:53,160
It is not as useful for moving value across space.

2145
01:41:53,160 --> 01:41:54,920
This is another definition of money, by the way,

2146
01:41:54,920 --> 01:41:58,120
a social device for moving value across space and time.

2147
01:41:59,480 --> 01:42:03,960
So to rectify this technological shortcoming of gold,

2148
01:42:03,960 --> 01:42:07,320
we introduced, first of all,

2149
01:42:07,320 --> 01:42:09,840
the custody of gold was gradually centralized

2150
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:14,840
into fewer and fewer warehousing operations.

2151
01:42:14,840 --> 01:42:16,920
This is because there are economies of scale

2152
01:42:16,920 --> 01:42:20,200
associated with using gold as money

2153
01:42:20,200 --> 01:42:22,320
and that if you centralize the custody,

2154
01:42:22,320 --> 01:42:25,720
the warehouse owner can then issue a paper receipt

2155
01:42:25,720 --> 01:42:27,800
called a warehouse receipt for that gold.

2156
01:42:27,800 --> 01:42:30,360
And then market participants can trade that paper

2157
01:42:30,360 --> 01:42:31,760
as if it's good as gold.

2158
01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:33,440
And everyone has an option at any time

2159
01:42:33,440 --> 01:42:36,120
to go and redeem real gold from the warehouse.

2160
01:42:36,120 --> 01:42:38,520
So that system works.

2161
01:42:38,520 --> 01:42:42,680
Until the problem with it is that it introduces the need

2162
01:42:42,680 --> 01:42:44,160
to trust the custodian.

2163
01:42:44,160 --> 01:42:45,880
So it's introducing counterparty risk

2164
01:42:45,880 --> 01:42:47,680
in the form of the custodian.

2165
01:42:47,680 --> 01:42:52,120
And now should that warehouse choose to increase the supply

2166
01:42:52,120 --> 01:42:55,440
of paper notes to gold beyond its supply.

2167
01:42:55,440 --> 01:42:57,600
So if it's got three tons of gold

2168
01:42:57,600 --> 01:43:00,920
and it issues six tons worth of paper receipts,

2169
01:43:00,920 --> 01:43:03,480
all of a sudden it's participating in a fraud.

2170
01:43:03,480 --> 01:43:04,560
It's basically lying.

2171
01:43:04,560 --> 01:43:06,200
It's representing that it has more gold

2172
01:43:06,200 --> 01:43:08,560
than it actually does.

2173
01:43:08,560 --> 01:43:12,840
And that is the pathway that we got into banking

2174
01:43:12,840 --> 01:43:14,040
and central banking.

2175
01:43:14,040 --> 01:43:16,600
Is we needed a convenience mechanism

2176
01:43:16,600 --> 01:43:19,480
to rectify the portability shortcomings of gold.

2177
01:43:19,480 --> 01:43:22,240
We needed to be able to move value across space, right?

2178
01:43:22,240 --> 01:43:24,680
Gold was doing a great job at moving value over time,

2179
01:43:24,680 --> 01:43:26,080
but not space.

2180
01:43:26,080 --> 01:43:27,440
Paper currency gave us the ability

2181
01:43:27,440 --> 01:43:29,160
to move value across space,

2182
01:43:29,160 --> 01:43:31,600
but it introduced this attack vector

2183
01:43:31,600 --> 01:43:34,240
for warehouse operators, which became banks,

2184
01:43:34,240 --> 01:43:38,440
which became central banks to modify the supply

2185
01:43:38,440 --> 01:43:40,000
to suit their own political agendas.

2186
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:41,440
Added the snooze button.

2187
01:43:42,360 --> 01:43:45,920
That allows you to just do a little fraud.

2188
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:47,320
To get something for nothing.

2189
01:43:47,320 --> 01:43:49,520
Something, just a little bit at first.

2190
01:43:49,520 --> 01:43:52,920
Just this one morning, just a little bit.

2191
01:43:53,840 --> 01:43:58,560
I mean, I don't know if you can speak to the birth

2192
01:43:58,560 --> 01:44:00,160
of a fiat currency.

2193
01:44:00,160 --> 01:44:05,000
Is there some interesting characteristics to that,

2194
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,640
those early steps that created it?

2195
01:44:07,640 --> 01:44:10,000
Like, could it have been averted?

2196
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:15,000
Or is this the natural progression of governments?

2197
01:44:15,960 --> 01:44:19,240
You know, what's funny is that central banking

2198
01:44:19,240 --> 01:44:23,520
was initially designed to be the custodian of gold, right?

2199
01:44:23,520 --> 01:44:26,600
So they were going to custody the gold,

2200
01:44:26,600 --> 01:44:28,680
issue paper on top of it.

2201
01:44:28,680 --> 01:44:31,440
And then they would maintain,

2202
01:44:31,440 --> 01:44:33,400
you could trust the public stamp effectively.

2203
01:44:33,400 --> 01:44:34,800
You could trust that the central bank

2204
01:44:34,800 --> 01:44:37,400
had as much gold on reserve as they said they had.

2205
01:44:37,400 --> 01:44:39,240
And they were supposed to be the trustworthy institution.

2206
01:44:39,240 --> 01:44:42,120
So we went from placing our trust

2207
01:44:42,120 --> 01:44:44,680
in a free market game theoretic process,

2208
01:44:44,680 --> 01:44:45,920
or trusting gold,

2209
01:44:45,920 --> 01:44:48,240
and we began trusting this institution instead.

2210
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:54,400
That institution would not have arisen

2211
01:44:54,400 --> 01:44:58,120
if the portability of gold was really high.

2212
01:44:58,120 --> 01:45:00,360
If we could have somehow sent gold

2213
01:45:00,360 --> 01:45:02,280
across a telecommunications channel,

2214
01:45:02,280 --> 01:45:05,040
there would have been no need for a central bank.

2215
01:45:05,040 --> 01:45:07,520
Everyone could have custodied their gold

2216
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:10,720
in any information bearing medium, frankly,

2217
01:45:10,720 --> 01:45:13,720
and they could beam it around the world at any time.

2218
01:45:13,720 --> 01:45:16,880
So this whole institution itself

2219
01:45:16,880 --> 01:45:21,040
is rooted in a technological shortcoming of gold.

2220
01:45:21,040 --> 01:45:24,120
So I think it's, another way to think about that

2221
01:45:24,120 --> 01:45:28,600
is maybe had there been all the gold in the world today

2222
01:45:28,600 --> 01:45:31,000
fills two Olympic sized swimming pools,

2223
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:32,960
all the gold mined throughout all of human history.

2224
01:45:32,960 --> 01:45:34,800
So there's not a lot, right?

2225
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,760
What if there had been just like way more?

2226
01:45:38,760 --> 01:45:39,600
There'd just been, I don't know,

2227
01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:41,840
20,000 Olympic swimming pools worth.

2228
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:45,320
Portability wouldn't have been as much of an issue, right?

2229
01:45:45,320 --> 01:45:47,000
We could have, and this is to say,

2230
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:48,960
assuming gold was still the most scarce metal

2231
01:45:48,960 --> 01:45:50,040
in all these things,

2232
01:45:52,160 --> 01:45:53,480
portability would have been less of an issue.

2233
01:45:53,480 --> 01:45:56,000
We would have had less dependence

2234
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
or need for a central bank.

2235
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,240
So I think it's kind of idiosyncratic

2236
01:46:00,240 --> 01:46:03,760
in that we just happened to end up here on this planet

2237
01:46:03,760 --> 01:46:05,160
with a certain amount of gold,

2238
01:46:05,160 --> 01:46:07,440
it best satisfied the properties of money.

2239
01:46:07,440 --> 01:46:09,120
And a certain amount of humans,

2240
01:46:09,120 --> 01:46:12,160
geographically dispersed such that portability

2241
01:46:12,160 --> 01:46:14,320
had certain properties that you want to achieve

2242
01:46:14,320 --> 01:46:16,120
for humans in a geographical space

2243
01:46:16,120 --> 01:46:18,760
to be able to be a exchange value.

2244
01:46:18,760 --> 01:46:20,960
It became more of an issue as we globalized, right?

2245
01:46:20,960 --> 01:46:22,600
As we became more of a global society,

2246
01:46:22,600 --> 01:46:26,240
we needed money that could move across space really fast,

2247
01:46:26,240 --> 01:46:27,080
right?

2248
01:46:27,080 --> 01:46:29,680
So we could trade in international capital markets.

2249
01:46:29,680 --> 01:46:33,560
So that drove the central bank

2250
01:46:33,560 --> 01:46:35,720
to become the dominant institution of the world.

2251
01:46:35,720 --> 01:46:39,120
And if you follow the flows of gold throughout history,

2252
01:46:39,120 --> 01:46:41,240
you know, I've been watching this documentary

2253
01:46:41,240 --> 01:46:43,680
on World War I and World War II on Netflix.

2254
01:46:43,680 --> 01:46:45,880
I think it's called World War II and Color.

2255
01:46:45,880 --> 01:46:47,720
Oh yeah, that's really good.

2256
01:46:47,720 --> 01:46:48,560
So good.

2257
01:46:48,560 --> 01:46:53,560
And when I say gold has been the governor of governments

2258
01:46:53,560 --> 01:46:55,160
or gold is geopolitical money,

2259
01:46:55,160 --> 01:46:59,200
like it is the base layer operating system,

2260
01:46:59,200 --> 01:47:00,720
has been the base layer operating system

2261
01:47:00,720 --> 01:47:02,200
for analog society.

2262
01:47:02,200 --> 01:47:04,600
So it's always been about who controls the gold,

2263
01:47:05,720 --> 01:47:07,800
is who makes the rules.

2264
01:47:07,800 --> 01:47:11,240
And that's, in that context,

2265
01:47:11,240 --> 01:47:12,760
is why Bitcoin is so interesting

2266
01:47:12,760 --> 01:47:16,320
because it is the disruptor to

2267
01:47:16,320 --> 01:47:18,800
this base level operating system

2268
01:47:18,800 --> 01:47:22,000
that's functioned for all of human history.

2269
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,400
I think this is a good place to ask,

2270
01:47:24,400 --> 01:47:26,280
we asked the what is money question.

2271
01:47:27,840 --> 01:47:29,040
What is Bitcoin?

2272
01:47:31,880 --> 01:47:35,120
That's a question as complicated as what is money.

2273
01:47:35,120 --> 01:47:39,480
I think if you get a general understanding of money

2274
01:47:39,480 --> 01:47:42,800
from a number of angles,

2275
01:47:42,800 --> 01:47:47,800
that we could say Bitcoin is the most superior

2276
01:47:47,880 --> 01:47:50,480
monetary technology that has ever existed.

2277
01:47:51,560 --> 01:47:54,760
So one of the most superior implementation

2278
01:47:54,760 --> 01:47:56,720
of the ideas of money that you talked about,

2279
01:47:56,720 --> 01:47:58,320
you talked about money as speech,

2280
01:47:58,320 --> 01:48:00,080
you talked about money as an idea,

2281
01:48:00,960 --> 01:48:04,000
we talked about money as sovereignty.

2282
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,480
Yeah, so we're attaching the concept of money

2283
01:48:06,480 --> 01:48:11,480
to your point, to whatever tool best satisfies

2284
01:48:11,480 --> 01:48:13,760
those properties of money

2285
01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:16,840
or best renders those services we need for money.

2286
01:48:16,840 --> 01:48:19,320
And as you said, you're using the word tool

2287
01:48:19,320 --> 01:48:20,720
and technology interchangeably here.

2288
01:48:20,720 --> 01:48:22,320
Yes, yes.

2289
01:48:22,320 --> 01:48:24,840
And another thing to think about here is that

2290
01:48:24,840 --> 01:48:28,480
we think often in terms of goods or services,

2291
01:48:28,480 --> 01:48:31,880
but actually everything is a service.

2292
01:48:31,880 --> 01:48:35,520
So it's not the physical properties of this pen

2293
01:48:35,520 --> 01:48:36,800
that I find valuable,

2294
01:48:36,800 --> 01:48:38,800
it's the services that it renders to me,

2295
01:48:38,800 --> 01:48:40,440
that I want to write a letter,

2296
01:48:40,440 --> 01:48:45,440
this serves me by allowing me to lay ink on paper

2297
01:48:45,800 --> 01:48:47,880
and communicate information.

2298
01:48:47,880 --> 01:48:52,480
So value, humans attach value,

2299
01:48:52,480 --> 01:48:56,400
as we alluded to earlier, to services, not goods.

2300
01:48:56,400 --> 01:48:58,960
So the properties or the services that money renders

2301
01:48:58,960 --> 01:49:01,600
that human beings value are those five properties,

2302
01:49:01,600 --> 01:49:03,640
divisibility, durability, recognizability,

2303
01:49:03,640 --> 01:49:05,120
portability, scarcity.

2304
01:49:06,040 --> 01:49:10,120
Metals best satisfied those services historically,

2305
01:49:10,120 --> 01:49:13,120
but Bitcoin as the most superior monetary technology

2306
01:49:13,120 --> 01:49:17,400
in human history, essentially perfects them.

2307
01:49:17,400 --> 01:49:19,200
It's as close to perfection as we've ever been.

2308
01:49:19,200 --> 01:49:21,800
So in terms of divisibility,

2309
01:49:21,800 --> 01:49:25,160
each Bitcoin can be broken down into 100 million subunits

2310
01:49:25,160 --> 01:49:26,240
called a Satoshi.

2311
01:49:29,280 --> 01:49:31,520
If that divisibility were ever a problem,

2312
01:49:31,520 --> 01:49:35,160
which actually there was a question that came up recently,

2313
01:49:35,160 --> 01:49:37,480
if you divide the world population

2314
01:49:37,480 --> 01:49:38,800
by the total supply of Bitcoin,

2315
01:49:38,800 --> 01:49:42,040
you end up at like 0.3 Bitcoin per person,

2316
01:49:42,040 --> 01:49:46,080
call it 300,000 Satoshis per person.

2317
01:49:46,080 --> 01:49:50,600
What if that was not enough to facilitate economic activity?

2318
01:49:50,600 --> 01:49:53,240
And the answer to that is Bitcoin can soft fork

2319
01:49:53,240 --> 01:49:54,600
into further divisibility.

2320
01:49:54,600 --> 01:49:57,040
So if Bitcoin ate all the money in the world

2321
01:49:58,160 --> 01:50:00,520
and the average Bitcoin or wealth

2322
01:50:00,520 --> 01:50:02,120
will say 300,000 Satoshis each,

2323
01:50:02,120 --> 01:50:06,200
but that wasn't divisible enough maybe to buy coffee

2324
01:50:06,200 --> 01:50:07,600
and do all these day-to-day transactions,

2325
01:50:07,600 --> 01:50:08,440
what would happen?

2326
01:50:08,440 --> 01:50:09,800
It would increase its divisibility.

2327
01:50:09,800 --> 01:50:12,480
So Bitcoin's perfected divisibility.

2328
01:50:12,480 --> 01:50:16,440
The divisibility of money lets us transact across scales.

2329
01:50:16,440 --> 01:50:18,440
We can buy coffee or we can buy a house.

2330
01:50:21,200 --> 01:50:23,120
Durability is an interesting one.

2331
01:50:23,120 --> 01:50:25,360
So clearly something like gold is very durable.

2332
01:50:25,360 --> 01:50:28,240
It's resistant to degradation over time.

2333
01:50:28,240 --> 01:50:30,240
Bitcoin is just pure information,

2334
01:50:30,240 --> 01:50:33,520
but it's stored in a distributed format.

2335
01:50:33,520 --> 01:50:36,960
So information stored in a distributed fashion

2336
01:50:36,960 --> 01:50:40,800
tends to be virtually infinitely durable.

2337
01:50:40,800 --> 01:50:41,760
The example I'd like to give here

2338
01:50:41,760 --> 01:50:43,560
is something like the Bible.

2339
01:50:43,560 --> 01:50:46,080
The Bible is just distributed information.

2340
01:50:46,080 --> 01:50:49,200
It's stored everywhere and nowhere, so to speak.

2341
01:50:49,200 --> 01:50:52,040
And for that reason, it has outlasted empires.

2342
01:50:53,120 --> 01:50:54,320
And Bitcoin's similar, right?

2343
01:50:54,320 --> 01:50:57,040
You can't make changes to it unilaterally.

2344
01:50:57,040 --> 01:51:01,920
But to make explicit the ways in which it is not durable

2345
01:51:01,920 --> 01:51:05,400
is the fact that it relies on computing infrastructure.

2346
01:51:05,400 --> 01:51:08,320
Like it needs computers.

2347
01:51:08,320 --> 01:51:11,280
So if you were to destroy all the computers in the world,

2348
01:51:11,280 --> 01:51:15,400
yes, it needs mechanisms that store

2349
01:51:15,400 --> 01:51:16,680
and transfer information.

2350
01:51:16,680 --> 01:51:17,600
That's right.

2351
01:51:17,600 --> 01:51:20,080
And so you could attack it.

2352
01:51:20,080 --> 01:51:22,080
I mean, you could attack gold in the same kind of way,

2353
01:51:22,080 --> 01:51:23,800
I suppose, through the physics,

2354
01:51:23,800 --> 01:51:26,960
but it's probably easier to destroy all the computers

2355
01:51:26,960 --> 01:51:30,320
in the world than it is destroy all the gold in the world.

2356
01:51:30,320 --> 01:51:31,280
Maybe not.

2357
01:51:31,280 --> 01:51:32,360
I don't know.

2358
01:51:32,360 --> 01:51:33,200
Anyway.

2359
01:51:33,200 --> 01:51:35,640
Yeah, you're right.

2360
01:51:35,640 --> 01:51:38,440
Maybe, I'm not sure which one would be harder to destroy.

2361
01:51:38,440 --> 01:51:41,880
But the other thing is there's a dynamic incentive.

2362
01:51:41,880 --> 01:51:44,800
So every time you destroy Bitcoin miners,

2363
01:51:44,800 --> 01:51:46,560
you're creating incentives for anyone else

2364
01:51:46,560 --> 01:51:48,880
with access to electricity to mine

2365
01:51:48,880 --> 01:51:50,680
because you're making the algorithm easier.

2366
01:51:50,680 --> 01:51:54,080
Yeah, so the destruction is difficult

2367
01:51:54,080 --> 01:51:56,560
because of the decentralized nature of the whole thing.

2368
01:51:56,560 --> 01:51:57,880
And the difficulty adjustment.

2369
01:51:57,880 --> 01:52:00,480
Yeah, so you're gonna have to use nuclear weapons

2370
01:52:00,480 --> 01:52:02,040
and cover the whole globe.

2371
01:52:02,040 --> 01:52:02,880
But anyway.

2372
01:52:02,880 --> 01:52:05,000
Yeah, and by then we've got much bigger problems

2373
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:05,840
than money, right?

2374
01:52:05,840 --> 01:52:08,080
That's right.

2375
01:52:08,080 --> 01:52:09,680
So, okay, so that's durability.

2376
01:52:09,680 --> 01:52:12,320
So portability, Bitcoin's pure information,

2377
01:52:12,320 --> 01:52:13,680
it can move at the speed of light,

2378
01:52:13,680 --> 01:52:15,920
can't get much faster than that.

2379
01:52:15,920 --> 01:52:20,600
Recognizability refers to the ability to verify

2380
01:52:20,600 --> 01:52:23,400
the veracity of the money or its authenticity.

2381
01:52:23,400 --> 01:52:27,360
So you can actually, when we used to transact gold,

2382
01:52:27,360 --> 01:52:28,680
there were time-honored techniques

2383
01:52:28,680 --> 01:52:31,040
for verifying that it was gold

2384
01:52:31,040 --> 01:52:33,000
and not gold-plated lead, for instance.

2385
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:34,880
This is where we get the term sound money.

2386
01:52:34,880 --> 01:52:36,800
A gold coin made a very particular sound

2387
01:52:36,800 --> 01:52:38,320
when dropped from a certain height.

2388
01:52:38,320 --> 01:52:40,240
You know, you've seen people biting coins.

2389
01:52:40,240 --> 01:52:41,120
These are all techniques

2390
01:52:41,120 --> 01:52:44,120
for testing the authenticity of gold.

2391
01:52:44,120 --> 01:52:46,480
And with Bitcoin, we have something unique

2392
01:52:46,480 --> 01:52:48,320
in that if you're running a full node,

2393
01:52:48,320 --> 01:52:51,200
you can verify that the Bitcoin is Bitcoin, right?

2394
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:54,920
It cannot be tampered with, it cannot be faked.

2395
01:52:54,920 --> 01:52:57,280
And in addition to that, as a node operator,

2396
01:52:57,280 --> 01:53:00,040
you can audit the total supply of Bitcoin at any time,

2397
01:53:00,040 --> 01:53:01,600
which is unlike any money in history.

2398
01:53:01,600 --> 01:53:04,200
So you know with full certainty,

2399
01:53:04,200 --> 01:53:06,840
if you're holding 1,000 Bitcoin,

2400
01:53:06,840 --> 01:53:10,440
you have 1,000 out of a possible 21 million forever.

2401
01:53:10,440 --> 01:53:13,080
You have a guaranteed fraction of the total supply.

2402
01:53:13,080 --> 01:53:14,800
Yeah, so a full node contains information

2403
01:53:14,800 --> 01:53:16,640
about every transaction that's ever been had,

2404
01:53:16,640 --> 01:53:19,240
so you can figure out, yeah, I mean,

2405
01:53:19,240 --> 01:53:23,880
all the truth of this money is all right there.

2406
01:53:23,880 --> 01:53:25,840
Yeah, it's like a fractal constituent

2407
01:53:25,840 --> 01:53:27,160
of the whole network, right?

2408
01:53:27,160 --> 01:53:30,840
The whole Bitcoin blockchain is comprised in a node too.

2409
01:53:30,840 --> 01:53:32,200
Not the proof of work piece,

2410
01:53:32,200 --> 01:53:34,000
but the entire transaction history.

2411
01:53:35,920 --> 01:53:37,080
And so that's unique as well.

2412
01:53:37,080 --> 01:53:40,000
And that's what makes Bitcoin the ultimate store of value

2413
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:43,840
is that you know with certainty what the total supply is

2414
01:53:43,840 --> 01:53:45,120
and will ever be.

2415
01:53:45,120 --> 01:53:49,480
And you know that your share of that supply is fixed.

2416
01:53:49,480 --> 01:53:50,520
It cannot change.

2417
01:53:50,520 --> 01:53:51,920
It can only improve, actually.

2418
01:53:51,920 --> 01:53:53,760
If someone loses, you know,

2419
01:53:53,760 --> 01:53:56,040
if the Satoshi stash is truly gone forever,

2420
01:53:56,040 --> 01:53:58,000
the million Bitcoin never moves,

2421
01:53:58,000 --> 01:53:59,960
then we're talking about 1,000 Bitcoin

2422
01:53:59,960 --> 01:54:03,160
out of 20 million instead, and so on and so forth.

2423
01:54:03,160 --> 01:54:05,760
As more people lose access to their Bitcoin,

2424
01:54:05,760 --> 01:54:08,080
they're basically making a contribution to everyone else.

2425
01:54:08,080 --> 01:54:09,560
It's anti-dilutive.

2426
01:54:10,440 --> 01:54:13,200
And there's certain properties of Bitcoin

2427
01:54:13,200 --> 01:54:15,520
that are sort of a little bit more into the details

2428
01:54:15,520 --> 01:54:19,080
that ensure that the full nodes,

2429
01:54:19,080 --> 01:54:22,880
like the size of all the transactions that ever happened,

2430
01:54:22,880 --> 01:54:24,320
at least currently can be stored

2431
01:54:24,320 --> 01:54:25,720
in a single computer, for example.

2432
01:54:25,720 --> 01:54:28,040
So it doesn't blow up too quickly.

2433
01:54:28,040 --> 01:54:28,880
That's right.

2434
01:54:28,880 --> 01:54:32,080
But you know, there's arguments that that's not necessarily,

2435
01:54:32,080 --> 01:54:35,640
you can make arguments for that to be a very nice property,

2436
01:54:35,640 --> 01:54:38,240
but you can also say that there's like drawbacks to it.

2437
01:54:38,240 --> 01:54:41,520
That's hence the block size debates

2438
01:54:41,520 --> 01:54:42,520
and all those kinds of things.

2439
01:54:42,520 --> 01:54:45,280
Yeah, that was the Bitcoin Cash Civil War, right,

2440
01:54:45,280 --> 01:54:47,560
was that particular piece.

2441
01:54:47,560 --> 01:54:48,400
Yeah.

2442
01:54:48,400 --> 01:54:50,760
And you know, ostensibly they were saying,

2443
01:54:50,760 --> 01:54:52,840
oh, we need more transaction throughput

2444
01:54:52,840 --> 01:54:55,360
to buy more coffee and do more transactions.

2445
01:54:55,360 --> 01:54:59,760
But what they were actually doing was increasing the size,

2446
01:55:00,840 --> 01:55:03,040
computing power necessary to run a full node,

2447
01:55:03,040 --> 01:55:06,800
which would have theoretically compromised decentralization.

2448
01:55:06,800 --> 01:55:09,520
So yeah, but it would in theory,

2449
01:55:09,520 --> 01:55:11,640
and this is, you know, in theory,

2450
01:55:11,640 --> 01:55:15,120
it would allow you to have much more transactions.

2451
01:55:15,120 --> 01:55:16,000
That's right.

2452
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,560
But the drawback, it would,

2453
01:55:18,560 --> 01:55:20,680
because of no longer can be stored

2454
01:55:20,680 --> 01:55:22,440
in a single computer, personal computer,

2455
01:55:22,440 --> 01:55:26,120
then it naturally leads to the centralization.

2456
01:55:26,120 --> 01:55:28,040
Same kind of thing we see with gold.

2457
01:55:28,040 --> 01:55:30,640
Which would have compromised its survivability.

2458
01:55:30,640 --> 01:55:31,760
Right.

2459
01:55:31,760 --> 01:55:34,280
So what else is there?

2460
01:55:34,280 --> 01:55:36,280
The last one, which leads straight into this one,

2461
01:55:36,280 --> 01:55:38,400
actually is the most important one of money,

2462
01:55:38,400 --> 01:55:39,960
which is scarcity.

2463
01:55:39,960 --> 01:55:44,960
And that you need to know the supply is fixed

2464
01:55:45,200 --> 01:55:49,440
and safeguarded from counterfeiting and inflation,

2465
01:55:49,440 --> 01:55:52,600
which counterfeiting and inflation are the same thing,

2466
01:55:52,600 --> 01:55:53,720
by the way.

2467
01:55:53,720 --> 01:55:57,480
Counterfeiting is criminalized inflation.

2468
01:55:57,480 --> 01:56:00,120
Inflation is legalized counterfeiting.

2469
01:56:00,120 --> 01:56:01,760
So central banks today,

2470
01:56:01,760 --> 01:56:03,200
when they say they're printing money, they're not.

2471
01:56:03,200 --> 01:56:05,480
They're counterfeiting currency.

2472
01:56:05,480 --> 01:56:07,120
That's a very important part.

2473
01:56:07,120 --> 01:56:10,400
And Bitcoin, as I've argued in some of my writing,

2474
01:56:11,360 --> 01:56:13,560
is more than just an invention.

2475
01:56:13,560 --> 01:56:16,840
It's actually the discovery of absolute scarcity

2476
01:56:16,840 --> 01:56:20,040
and that we have unveiled a property of money

2477
01:56:20,040 --> 01:56:22,080
that we will only discover once.

2478
01:56:23,800 --> 01:56:27,160
And it's got really major ramifications

2479
01:56:27,160 --> 01:56:28,720
for the world at large.

2480
01:56:28,720 --> 01:56:33,640
So with gold, for instance, as we've covered,

2481
01:56:33,640 --> 01:56:35,440
it became money because it was

2482
01:56:35,440 --> 01:56:38,000
the most relatively scarce monetary metal, right?

2483
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:41,120
Its supply was hardest to increase over time.

2484
01:56:41,120 --> 01:56:44,200
However, if we could somehow flip a switch today

2485
01:56:44,200 --> 01:56:46,920
and make everyone in the world go out and start mining gold,

2486
01:56:46,920 --> 01:56:49,080
we could increase the supply much more quickly.

2487
01:56:49,080 --> 01:56:50,960
We could, you know, its historic inflation rate's

2488
01:56:50,960 --> 01:56:53,480
about 2%, we could double that pretty quickly.

2489
01:56:54,960 --> 01:56:58,600
Bitcoin, with Bitcoin, it is not possible.

2490
01:56:58,600 --> 01:57:02,520
So no matter how much effort and energy and capital

2491
01:57:02,520 --> 01:57:05,520
and operational expenditure we pour into the mining network,

2492
01:57:05,520 --> 01:57:08,320
we cannot deviate from its fixed

2493
01:57:08,320 --> 01:57:11,000
and diminishing supply curve from between now

2494
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:13,600
and the last Bitcoin being mined in 2140

2495
01:57:13,600 --> 01:57:15,040
because of the difficulty adjustment.

2496
01:57:15,040 --> 01:57:18,400
It's constantly, it's adapting to human action, actually.

2497
01:57:18,400 --> 01:57:21,920
So the harder we pursue it, the more that it recedes,

2498
01:57:21,920 --> 01:57:23,320
and then the less we pursue it,

2499
01:57:23,320 --> 01:57:26,000
the more available it makes itself.

2500
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:30,320
And this is, it's a real major breakthrough

2501
01:57:30,320 --> 01:57:34,640
because it's the closest thing to perfect information

2502
01:57:34,640 --> 01:57:37,320
we've ever had in an economy.

2503
01:57:37,320 --> 01:57:40,280
And perfect information is this,

2504
01:57:40,280 --> 01:57:44,440
it's a theoretical but unattainable state of the market

2505
01:57:44,440 --> 01:57:48,400
where all market actors have all the relevant information

2506
01:57:48,400 --> 01:57:51,360
about everything so that they can compete

2507
01:57:51,360 --> 01:57:53,080
as efficiently as possible.

2508
01:57:53,080 --> 01:57:55,440
And in the state of pure information,

2509
01:57:55,440 --> 01:57:57,280
we have, I'm sorry, perfect information,

2510
01:57:57,280 --> 01:57:59,040
we have perfect competition.

2511
01:57:59,040 --> 01:58:03,120
And in perfect competition, we maximize wealth generation.

2512
01:58:03,120 --> 01:58:06,440
So we're competing as freely as possible

2513
01:58:06,440 --> 01:58:10,120
from coercive and violent impediments.

2514
01:58:10,120 --> 01:58:13,200
And so I think Bitcoin in that sense

2515
01:58:13,200 --> 01:58:17,240
is going to pull the world closer to a state

2516
01:58:18,360 --> 01:58:21,720
of perfect competition than we've ever been before,

2517
01:58:21,720 --> 01:58:24,560
which would increase wealth generation

2518
01:58:24,560 --> 01:58:26,400
to an extent we've never seen before.

2519
01:58:27,560 --> 01:58:30,440
Many of the things you said about Bitcoin

2520
01:58:30,440 --> 01:58:32,840
also hold for other cryptocurrency technologies

2521
01:58:32,840 --> 01:58:34,320
that followed after.

2522
01:58:34,320 --> 01:58:39,320
Can you say something to why you think Bitcoin

2523
01:58:40,680 --> 01:58:43,880
is the superior technology

2524
01:58:43,880 --> 01:58:48,880
from a pragmatic truth perspective than say Ethereum,

2525
01:58:49,200 --> 01:58:52,640
but also other crypto like Bitcoin Cash,

2526
01:58:52,640 --> 01:58:55,360
like other hard forks of Bitcoin

2527
01:58:55,360 --> 01:58:59,760
and maybe things that might yet to be invented,

2528
01:58:59,760 --> 01:59:01,400
tools yet to be invented?

2529
01:59:01,400 --> 01:59:05,080
Yeah, so this is a good point of argument

2530
01:59:05,080 --> 01:59:08,440
because a lot of people have countered me and said,

2531
01:59:08,440 --> 01:59:11,280
Bitcoin cannot be absolute scarcity

2532
01:59:11,280 --> 01:59:13,240
because you can fork it and create something

2533
01:59:13,240 --> 01:59:15,520
with the same properties as Bitcoin

2534
01:59:15,520 --> 01:59:17,720
or potentially even better properties, right?

2535
01:59:17,720 --> 01:59:20,520
You create something with a deflationary monetary policy.

2536
01:59:21,640 --> 01:59:23,640
That's what Bitcoin Cash was actually.

2537
01:59:23,640 --> 01:59:26,240
It forked Bitcoin with all of the same properties

2538
01:59:26,240 --> 01:59:29,280
except for the block size that we alluded to earlier.

2539
01:59:29,280 --> 01:59:33,000
The problem is that money is valued.

2540
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:36,600
Again, it's the good with a configuration of demand

2541
01:59:36,600 --> 01:59:40,400
that is predominantly marketability.

2542
01:59:40,400 --> 01:59:43,560
So it is valued based on its liquidity.

2543
01:59:43,560 --> 01:59:46,640
That is how many other trading partners are there

2544
01:59:46,640 --> 01:59:48,800
in that monetary network.

2545
01:59:48,800 --> 01:59:52,520
So it is a network valued

2546
01:59:52,520 --> 01:59:54,800
because of its liquidity and network effects.

2547
01:59:54,800 --> 01:59:58,640
So any new entrant into the market for money

2548
01:59:58,640 --> 02:00:02,800
is incentivized to always choose the money

2549
02:00:02,800 --> 02:00:06,520
with the deepest liquidity and the most network effects.

2550
02:00:06,520 --> 02:00:10,600
This is why money has tended to be a winner take all market

2551
02:00:10,600 --> 02:00:13,520
because it's essentially a single purpose tool, right?

2552
02:00:13,520 --> 02:00:15,680
It is a tool for,

2553
02:00:16,640 --> 02:00:19,720
if we consider that tools are time-saving devices, right?

2554
02:00:19,720 --> 02:00:21,720
The shovel that you dig more holes per man hour

2555
02:00:21,720 --> 02:00:23,200
than you can with your bare hands.

2556
02:00:23,200 --> 02:00:26,320
Money is a tool, there's yet another definition of money

2557
02:00:26,320 --> 02:00:28,600
that lets us calculate, negotiate,

2558
02:00:28,600 --> 02:00:30,560
and execute trades more quickly.

2559
02:00:31,560 --> 02:00:36,560
So that function tends to coalesce towards one solution.

2560
02:00:38,520 --> 02:00:40,920
And so the short answer would be that

2561
02:00:40,920 --> 02:00:44,640
for the same reasons, quantifiable reasons, right?

2562
02:00:44,640 --> 02:00:46,120
Like inflation resistance

2563
02:00:46,120 --> 02:00:48,520
and liquidity and network effects,

2564
02:00:48,520 --> 02:00:50,680
that we have one analog gold,

2565
02:00:50,680 --> 02:00:53,600
we're only likely to have one digital gold.

2566
02:00:53,600 --> 02:00:57,240
And I think the Bitcoin Cash Fork proves that out empirically.

2567
02:00:57,240 --> 02:00:59,560
It's a good case study because-

2568
02:00:59,560 --> 02:01:00,880
What for case study, right?

2569
02:01:00,880 --> 02:01:03,000
But okay, so that's really well put.

2570
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:04,600
So like gold was sticky.

2571
02:01:05,960 --> 02:01:08,480
Once it was accepted the network effects,

2572
02:01:08,480 --> 02:01:11,040
the winner take all took over.

2573
02:01:11,040 --> 02:01:15,400
And here's a fundamentally different kind of like

2574
02:01:15,400 --> 02:01:18,720
analog versus digital is a leap in technologies.

2575
02:01:18,720 --> 02:01:19,920
That's right.

2576
02:01:19,920 --> 02:01:24,080
And you're suggesting that there may not be,

2577
02:01:25,320 --> 02:01:29,120
there's unlikely to be other leaps of that kind

2578
02:01:29,120 --> 02:01:32,280
into a whole nother kind of space of technologies.

2579
02:01:32,280 --> 02:01:34,720
I would argue that Bitcoin,

2580
02:01:34,720 --> 02:01:38,040
it's kind of like the ideological synthesis of gold,

2581
02:01:38,040 --> 02:01:39,400
taking the monetary properties of gold

2582
02:01:39,400 --> 02:01:41,880
and combining them with the internet itself.

2583
02:01:41,880 --> 02:01:43,240
And in doing so,

2584
02:01:43,240 --> 02:01:47,160
it has essentially perfected the properties of money, right?

2585
02:01:47,160 --> 02:01:49,120
You can't get more divisible, durable,

2586
02:01:49,120 --> 02:01:51,800
recognizable, portable, or scarce than Bitcoin.

2587
02:01:51,800 --> 02:01:54,240
So Satoshi has kind of,

2588
02:01:54,240 --> 02:01:58,360
he left no design space for a superior technology

2589
02:01:58,360 --> 02:02:01,320
to intercede and out-compete Bitcoin at this point,

2590
02:02:01,320 --> 02:02:02,880
now that it's established liquidity in the network.

2591
02:02:02,880 --> 02:02:04,760
Far superior technology, right?

2592
02:02:04,760 --> 02:02:07,360
Yeah, but it's a combination of the tech itself

2593
02:02:07,360 --> 02:02:08,680
and the social layer.

2594
02:02:08,680 --> 02:02:09,520
And the social layer.

2595
02:02:09,520 --> 02:02:10,360
That is coalesced to it.

2596
02:02:10,360 --> 02:02:11,760
You can't separate those two out.

2597
02:02:11,760 --> 02:02:12,600
That's right.

2598
02:02:12,600 --> 02:02:15,400
They're all connected and then the political as well.

2599
02:02:15,400 --> 02:02:17,480
But the portability, for example,

2600
02:02:17,480 --> 02:02:20,080
that's another way to phrase that is the,

2601
02:02:20,080 --> 02:02:20,920
what is it?

2602
02:02:20,920 --> 02:02:22,040
The scaling.

2603
02:02:22,040 --> 02:02:24,440
So the number of transactions,

2604
02:02:24,440 --> 02:02:27,120
that's a limitation for Bitcoin

2605
02:02:27,120 --> 02:02:29,560
that many argue is a feature,

2606
02:02:29,560 --> 02:02:30,920
many argue is a bug.

2607
02:02:30,920 --> 02:02:33,520
You have a bunch of cryptocurrency technologies

2608
02:02:33,520 --> 02:02:37,080
that are able to achieve much higher,

2609
02:02:37,080 --> 02:02:40,440
much faster frequency of transactions,

2610
02:02:40,440 --> 02:02:42,440
much more transactions, you know,

2611
02:02:42,440 --> 02:02:43,600
all that kind of stuff.

2612
02:02:44,760 --> 02:02:46,440
What are your thoughts on that?

2613
02:02:46,440 --> 02:02:49,640
You know, the low level of transactions

2614
02:02:49,640 --> 02:02:51,760
that's possible with Bitcoin,

2615
02:02:51,760 --> 02:02:52,880
do you think that's a feature?

2616
02:02:52,880 --> 02:02:54,480
Do you think that's a bug?

2617
02:02:54,480 --> 02:02:56,880
Necessary for security, actually.

2618
02:02:56,880 --> 02:02:59,000
And even these other crypto assets

2619
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:00,280
that settle more quickly,

2620
02:03:00,280 --> 02:03:03,640
they settle with less assurance of finality.

2621
02:03:03,640 --> 02:03:06,560
So Nick Carter has a great piece on this actually called,

2622
02:03:06,560 --> 02:03:09,280
it's the settlement assurance is stupid.

2623
02:03:09,280 --> 02:03:10,120
It's really good.

2624
02:03:10,120 --> 02:03:14,040
Where the gist of it is that there is more work

2625
02:03:14,040 --> 02:03:16,800
being done in each block of Bitcoin

2626
02:03:16,800 --> 02:03:20,720
that it is less vulnerable to reversion.

2627
02:03:20,720 --> 02:03:23,920
So it's giving you higher degrees of assurance

2628
02:03:23,920 --> 02:03:25,480
that your settlement or your trade

2629
02:03:25,480 --> 02:03:27,400
has occurred with finality.

2630
02:03:27,400 --> 02:03:30,160
Whereas other blockchains are much more vulnerable.

2631
02:03:31,320 --> 02:03:32,840
And again, with Bitcoin,

2632
02:03:34,240 --> 02:03:36,760
the evolutionary path of money with gold

2633
02:03:36,760 --> 02:03:40,640
is that it was first used as a collectible.

2634
02:03:40,640 --> 02:03:43,160
It then became used as a store value.

2635
02:03:43,160 --> 02:03:44,760
After it had stored enough value,

2636
02:03:44,760 --> 02:03:48,760
it began to be used as a medium of exchange.

2637
02:03:48,760 --> 02:03:50,280
And then finally, when it was used widely enough

2638
02:03:50,280 --> 02:03:52,600
as a medium of exchange, it becomes a unit of account.

2639
02:03:52,600 --> 02:03:54,960
We actually start to think in the money.

2640
02:03:54,960 --> 02:03:57,720
Bitcoin's following a similar path.

2641
02:03:57,720 --> 02:04:00,440
So started out as kind of a collectible.

2642
02:04:00,440 --> 02:04:02,280
Today, I would argue it's a store value,

2643
02:04:02,280 --> 02:04:05,640
one of the most effective store value we've ever seen.

2644
02:04:05,640 --> 02:04:08,600
So that evolutionary path that Bitcoin's following

2645
02:04:08,600 --> 02:04:10,280
is similar to gold.

2646
02:04:10,280 --> 02:04:12,280
First a collectible, today is store value.

2647
02:04:12,280 --> 02:04:13,960
To be an effective store value,

2648
02:04:13,960 --> 02:04:18,560
it has to optimize for supply cap.

2649
02:04:18,560 --> 02:04:19,920
That has to be the first,

2650
02:04:19,920 --> 02:04:22,320
and this is all Bitcoin really needs to do

2651
02:04:22,320 --> 02:04:23,800
to be successful, by the way.

2652
02:04:23,800 --> 02:04:25,880
Exactly what it's been doing for 12 years,

2653
02:04:25,880 --> 02:04:27,440
virtually flawlessly,

2654
02:04:27,440 --> 02:04:30,360
which is keep creating a block every 10 minutes

2655
02:04:30,360 --> 02:04:33,160
and keep enforcing a supply cap of 21 million.

2656
02:04:34,040 --> 02:04:35,880
As long as those two things hold,

2657
02:04:36,880 --> 02:04:40,640
it is sound money, the ultimate sound money.

2658
02:04:40,640 --> 02:04:44,680
The most inflation resistant money there's ever been.

2659
02:04:44,680 --> 02:04:47,840
It's actually completely immune.

2660
02:04:47,840 --> 02:04:50,360
It's taken unexpected inflation to 0%.

2661
02:04:50,360 --> 02:04:51,680
We know with perfect certainty

2662
02:04:51,680 --> 02:04:53,440
what Bitcoin supply will ever be.

2663
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:59,600
For it to be used more broadly as a medium of exchange,

2664
02:04:59,600 --> 02:05:02,280
it can't make trade-offs at the base layer

2665
02:05:02,280 --> 02:05:05,360
to increase its portability, for instance.

2666
02:05:05,360 --> 02:05:08,040
Even though portability is maybe kind of a misnomer,

2667
02:05:08,040 --> 02:05:10,680
because Bitcoin has extremely high portability,

2668
02:05:10,680 --> 02:05:13,560
just doesn't have extremely high transaction throughput.

2669
02:05:13,560 --> 02:05:16,760
So we could say you can move it pretty quickly

2670
02:05:16,760 --> 02:05:17,600
anywhere in the world,

2671
02:05:17,600 --> 02:05:21,040
as long as you're willing to bid up for the block space,

2672
02:05:21,040 --> 02:05:25,040
but you can't satisfy all the world's economic volume.

2673
02:05:25,040 --> 02:05:27,160
You can't do 300 million transactions per second

2674
02:05:27,160 --> 02:05:29,640
like you can on a centralized database like Visa.

2675
02:05:30,760 --> 02:05:34,800
But Bitcoin needs to be this,

2676
02:05:34,800 --> 02:05:36,440
it has to be a store value first

2677
02:05:36,440 --> 02:05:38,800
before it can be a medium of exchange.

2678
02:05:38,800 --> 02:05:42,680
So it has to protect the supply cap first

2679
02:05:42,680 --> 02:05:44,400
before making any trade-offs for that.

2680
02:05:44,400 --> 02:05:48,400
And I would argue that that's why Bitcoin is so rigid,

2681
02:05:48,400 --> 02:05:50,200
is that it's optimized for survivability

2682
02:05:50,200 --> 02:05:51,800
and optimized for that supply cap.

2683
02:05:51,800 --> 02:05:56,160
And it's pushing experimentation and other features

2684
02:05:56,160 --> 02:05:57,840
that would increase its transaction throughput

2685
02:05:57,840 --> 02:05:59,480
to higher layers.

2686
02:05:59,480 --> 02:06:01,480
So I think Lightning Network

2687
02:06:01,480 --> 02:06:03,520
is something that's very interesting.

2688
02:06:03,520 --> 02:06:07,640
It's still early, but there's a lot of throughput

2689
02:06:07,640 --> 02:06:10,600
already being used on the Lightning Network.

2690
02:06:10,600 --> 02:06:14,320
And it makes some slight trade-offs

2691
02:06:14,320 --> 02:06:16,160
in terms of the trust minimization of Bitcoin.

2692
02:06:16,160 --> 02:06:18,240
You end up trusting these smart contracts

2693
02:06:18,240 --> 02:06:19,600
instead to move the Bitcoin,

2694
02:06:19,600 --> 02:06:23,000
but you pick up nearly unlimited transaction throughput.

2695
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:25,680
So that's how, and that's how biology evolves.

2696
02:06:25,680 --> 02:06:26,840
That's how the internet evolved.

2697
02:06:26,840 --> 02:06:27,920
It evolves in layers.

2698
02:06:27,920 --> 02:06:31,120
So I think Bitcoin, you can sort of conceive of it

2699
02:06:31,120 --> 02:06:33,880
as the latest layer to the internet.

2700
02:06:33,880 --> 02:06:36,920
And it's one that preserves this store value property

2701
02:06:36,920 --> 02:06:39,000
better than any asset we've ever had.

2702
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:41,880
Let me ask sort of a critical question of,

2703
02:06:41,880 --> 02:06:46,120
if you're wrong about your statements about Bitcoin,

2704
02:06:48,800 --> 02:06:51,960
you find out years from now that you were wrong,

2705
02:06:51,960 --> 02:06:54,080
what would that look like?

2706
02:06:54,080 --> 02:06:55,360
What would be the things

2707
02:06:55,360 --> 02:06:57,600
that make you realize you were wrong?

2708
02:06:57,600 --> 02:07:01,360
Likely ideas or crazy out there ideas?

2709
02:07:01,360 --> 02:07:03,200
Do you think about this kind of stuff?

2710
02:07:03,200 --> 02:07:04,040
All the time.

2711
02:07:05,880 --> 02:07:08,520
Cause you speak very confidently about Bitcoin.

2712
02:07:08,520 --> 02:07:11,640
And one of the things, let me put it this way.

2713
02:07:11,640 --> 02:07:16,640
I think certainty, I feel like that's like a stoic statement

2714
02:07:16,640 --> 02:07:19,840
certainty leads to ruin or something like that.

2715
02:07:19,840 --> 02:07:24,840
Like certainty I think is an antithesis to progress often.

2716
02:07:24,840 --> 02:07:28,280
And especially in your writing,

2717
02:07:28,280 --> 02:07:29,960
but this is true for the Bitcoin community.

2718
02:07:29,960 --> 02:07:34,960
There's a certainty about the Bitcoin.

2719
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:36,880
And that makes me very skeptical,

2720
02:07:36,880 --> 02:07:38,880
no matter how good the ideas are.

2721
02:07:38,880 --> 02:07:42,240
Whenever things are good, this might be the Russian in me.

2722
02:07:42,240 --> 02:07:46,200
I think like, what are the ways this is gonna go wrong?

2723
02:07:46,200 --> 02:07:48,840
So what do you think are the ways this might go wrong

2724
02:07:48,840 --> 02:07:53,080
or you're wrong in your conception of what Bitcoin is?

2725
02:07:53,080 --> 02:07:58,080
Yeah, so science evolves via negativa,

2726
02:07:59,840 --> 02:08:04,240
meaning that we're not proving hypotheses

2727
02:08:04,240 --> 02:08:07,000
and that's what becomes the body of science.

2728
02:08:07,840 --> 02:08:12,560
Science is whatever is left over as we disprove hypotheses.

2729
02:08:12,560 --> 02:08:17,560
Whatever we can empirically through experimentation disprove

2730
02:08:18,680 --> 02:08:21,080
gets discarded and whatever remains,

2731
02:08:21,080 --> 02:08:24,280
whatever theory remains it hasn't been disproven

2732
02:08:24,280 --> 02:08:26,640
is science effectively.

2733
02:08:28,480 --> 02:08:33,480
This process is similar to market actors zeroing in

2734
02:08:33,560 --> 02:08:35,120
on a store value, right?

2735
02:08:35,120 --> 02:08:37,720
They're experimenting with different forms

2736
02:08:37,720 --> 02:08:41,160
of storing wealth across time.

2737
02:08:41,160 --> 02:08:42,520
Some do better than others.

2738
02:08:42,520 --> 02:08:45,520
And eventually everyone ends up on the one that is best.

2739
02:08:45,520 --> 02:08:46,760
That's what gold was.

2740
02:08:46,760 --> 02:08:50,280
In terms of understanding Bitcoin,

2741
02:08:50,280 --> 02:08:52,440
I look at it as a similar approach.

2742
02:08:52,440 --> 02:08:54,960
And that is the main question I'm asking myself is,

2743
02:08:54,960 --> 02:08:56,600
how do you stop this thing?

2744
02:08:56,600 --> 02:08:58,320
How do you turn it off?

2745
02:08:58,320 --> 02:08:59,160
How do you end it?

2746
02:08:59,160 --> 02:09:01,240
If you're a nation state particularly

2747
02:09:01,240 --> 02:09:04,080
who has the most to lose in this transition,

2748
02:09:04,080 --> 02:09:07,480
what is the attack vector by which they neutralize Bitcoin?

2749
02:09:07,480 --> 02:09:11,080
I mean, that is the $250 trillion question.

2750
02:09:11,080 --> 02:09:15,560
And I've spent five years thinking about this thing,

2751
02:09:15,560 --> 02:09:16,920
very deeply.

2752
02:09:16,920 --> 02:09:19,440
I've read everything on monetary history.

2753
02:09:19,440 --> 02:09:20,800
I can get my hands on.

2754
02:09:23,680 --> 02:09:27,880
The general thought of how it is stopped.

2755
02:09:27,880 --> 02:09:31,360
And this is the snag point that a lot of people get to

2756
02:09:31,360 --> 02:09:32,840
in their explorations down the rabbit hole

2757
02:09:32,840 --> 02:09:35,200
is they just say the government will never allow it.

2758
02:09:35,200 --> 02:09:36,560
And that becomes kind of their bottom.

2759
02:09:36,560 --> 02:09:37,800
It's like, all right, Bitcoin's interesting.

2760
02:09:37,800 --> 02:09:39,160
It's superior money, blah, blah, blah.

2761
02:09:39,160 --> 02:09:41,120
But the government will never allow it.

2762
02:09:41,120 --> 02:09:43,320
Was Ray Dalio, did he say that?

2763
02:09:43,320 --> 02:09:45,800
Ray Dalio was currently stuck there, yeah.

2764
02:09:45,800 --> 02:09:50,800
So Ray Dalio said that Bitcoin seems to be too promising.

2765
02:09:52,600 --> 02:09:55,880
If it is in fact as promising as it looks,

2766
02:09:56,760 --> 02:09:58,280
governments are going to,

2767
02:09:59,240 --> 02:10:02,280
I don't forget what the exact quote is, but not allowed.

2768
02:10:02,280 --> 02:10:03,640
Ban it.

2769
02:10:03,640 --> 02:10:05,320
Governments will ban it.

2770
02:10:05,320 --> 02:10:09,600
So how do you get Ray Dalio unstuck from your perspective?

2771
02:10:10,520 --> 02:10:12,760
And how do you get unstuck from that idea

2772
02:10:12,760 --> 02:10:14,880
that governments, will governments,

2773
02:10:14,880 --> 02:10:18,480
how do you prevent governments from stopping a thing

2774
02:10:18,480 --> 02:10:21,320
that threatens centralized power?

2775
02:10:22,600 --> 02:10:24,520
Well, Bitcoin is an idea.

2776
02:10:26,080 --> 02:10:30,320
So governments that are really good

2777
02:10:30,320 --> 02:10:35,120
at fighting centralized threats to their power, right?

2778
02:10:35,120 --> 02:10:36,720
Whether that's a currency counterfeiter

2779
02:10:36,720 --> 02:10:40,440
or a competing nation state or business they don't like

2780
02:10:40,440 --> 02:10:42,880
or an individual they don't like,

2781
02:10:42,880 --> 02:10:45,000
they can kill them, they can throw them in jail.

2782
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:46,720
They can use any number of course

2783
02:10:46,720 --> 02:10:49,360
of a violent tactics to suppress it.

2784
02:10:49,360 --> 02:10:52,640
But how do you point a gun at an idea?

2785
02:10:52,640 --> 02:10:56,600
How do you coerce an idea?

2786
02:10:58,720 --> 02:11:03,440
And that's, there's some anecdotal history here

2787
02:11:03,440 --> 02:11:08,440
where there's the PGP case, which in the United States,

2788
02:11:08,440 --> 02:11:12,360
the court was trying to classify it as munitions.

2789
02:11:12,360 --> 02:11:15,920
When we were shipping this pretty good privacy software

2790
02:11:15,920 --> 02:11:18,920
over overseas, government wanted to classify it

2791
02:11:18,920 --> 02:11:21,200
as munitions and restrict that exportation.

2792
02:11:22,400 --> 02:11:25,360
But, and this was a circuit court case precedent.

2793
02:11:25,360 --> 02:11:30,040
When the PGP attorneys actually printed out the source code

2794
02:11:30,040 --> 02:11:33,600
on paper and presented it as evidence in the court,

2795
02:11:33,600 --> 02:11:36,440
all of a sudden it became protected under freedom of speech

2796
02:11:36,440 --> 02:11:40,400
and that it's just code is speech, code is language.

2797
02:11:40,400 --> 02:11:43,120
And therefore, at least in the United States,

2798
02:11:43,120 --> 02:11:45,120
it's protected under the first amendment.

2799
02:11:47,960 --> 02:11:52,800
I think a government ban would be largely unenforceable,

2800
02:11:52,800 --> 02:11:54,600
frankly, on Bitcoin.

2801
02:11:54,600 --> 02:11:56,960
Being that it's pure information,

2802
02:11:56,960 --> 02:12:01,080
if you suppress market actors from using it

2803
02:12:01,080 --> 02:12:03,480
in one jurisdiction, you're just creating incentives

2804
02:12:03,480 --> 02:12:05,880
for them to go elsewhere.

2805
02:12:05,880 --> 02:12:07,480
And you're actually increasing the incentives

2806
02:12:07,480 --> 02:12:11,360
for other jurisdictions to be favorable towards it

2807
02:12:11,360 --> 02:12:12,920
because then they can create,

2808
02:12:12,920 --> 02:12:14,480
they get to benefit from the tax revenue

2809
02:12:14,480 --> 02:12:16,440
and the businesses and the innovation

2810
02:12:16,440 --> 02:12:19,400
that's occurring in and around Bitcoin as a result.

2811
02:12:19,400 --> 02:12:21,840
So you don't think if a particular central bank

2812
02:12:22,880 --> 02:12:25,960
like in Europe or United States bans it,

2813
02:12:26,880 --> 02:12:30,480
not maybe using those terms, but in some kind of way,

2814
02:12:30,480 --> 02:12:32,800
you think that provides a really strong incentive

2815
02:12:32,800 --> 02:12:36,400
for the other big players to enable it.

2816
02:12:36,400 --> 02:12:37,240
That's right.

2817
02:12:38,640 --> 02:12:40,680
And that they're more likely, by the way, since,

2818
02:12:40,680 --> 02:12:42,600
and the governments know this, by the way, too.

2819
02:12:42,600 --> 02:12:46,240
The other thing that causes a government

2820
02:12:46,240 --> 02:12:48,400
to shoot itself in the foot is that if they ban something,

2821
02:12:48,400 --> 02:12:50,600
they draw a lot of attention to it.

2822
02:12:50,600 --> 02:12:51,600
People are smart.

2823
02:12:51,600 --> 02:12:54,000
I mean, people ask why, why would a government ban it?

2824
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:55,280
Why can't I use this?

2825
02:12:55,280 --> 02:12:57,720
So that's kind of typically be the last arrow

2826
02:12:57,720 --> 02:12:58,560
in their quiver.

2827
02:12:59,840 --> 02:13:02,360
They may try to ban it if Bitcoin, you know,

2828
02:13:02,360 --> 02:13:04,160
really starts to monetize very quickly.

2829
02:13:04,160 --> 02:13:06,720
And this, the power structures that they impose today

2830
02:13:06,720 --> 02:13:11,160
start to dissolve faster than I, you know,

2831
02:13:11,160 --> 02:13:12,320
others might think they will,

2832
02:13:12,320 --> 02:13:13,480
then they might try and ban it.

2833
02:13:13,480 --> 02:13:16,720
But I think that ban will be largely unenforceable.

2834
02:13:17,840 --> 02:13:19,560
They're more likely to tax it,

2835
02:13:19,560 --> 02:13:21,560
which they already do tax it.

2836
02:13:21,560 --> 02:13:23,680
They're likely to increase taxation of it.

2837
02:13:25,080 --> 02:13:27,400
They would, they're likely to try and make it

2838
02:13:27,400 --> 02:13:30,920
more white market by actually tracing Bitcoin,

2839
02:13:30,920 --> 02:13:35,040
seeing who has it, attaching identities to Bitcoin ownership

2840
02:13:36,120 --> 02:13:38,360
and making sure that they're getting their pound of flesh

2841
02:13:38,360 --> 02:13:41,680
on all the transactions it results in.

2842
02:13:41,680 --> 02:13:45,840
But I don't think, the other thing about this is,

2843
02:13:47,440 --> 02:13:50,440
so we saw the internet out-compete intranets

2844
02:13:53,040 --> 02:13:55,240
in that we'd say that open source networks

2845
02:13:55,240 --> 02:13:57,120
tend to out-compete closed source networks.

2846
02:13:57,120 --> 02:13:59,360
And there's a really good reason for this.

2847
02:13:59,360 --> 02:14:02,280
And it's because in a closed source network,

2848
02:14:03,560 --> 02:14:05,960
there are costs associated with defending

2849
02:14:05,960 --> 02:14:07,000
the network itself.

2850
02:14:08,200 --> 02:14:12,200
So you have to, the network owners,

2851
02:14:12,200 --> 02:14:13,480
the owners of the closed source network

2852
02:14:13,480 --> 02:14:17,600
have to expend resources protecting it from competitors.

2853
02:14:17,600 --> 02:14:21,040
And they have to expend resources imposing its rules

2854
02:14:21,040 --> 02:14:23,240
because people, they're not voluntarily adopted rules.

2855
02:14:23,240 --> 02:14:25,400
So you actually have to impose these rule sets.

2856
02:14:25,400 --> 02:14:26,880
Whereas an open source network,

2857
02:14:26,880 --> 02:14:28,920
which is something much more akin to capitalism,

2858
02:14:28,920 --> 02:14:33,040
in its pure sense, these are voluntarily adopted rules.

2859
02:14:33,040 --> 02:14:34,920
So all market participants have agreed

2860
02:14:34,920 --> 02:14:36,760
and consented to this rule set.

2861
02:14:36,760 --> 02:14:38,440
So there's no enforcement costs

2862
02:14:38,440 --> 02:14:39,640
and there's no turf protection

2863
02:14:39,640 --> 02:14:43,040
because anyone can freely enter or exit the open network.

2864
02:14:43,040 --> 02:14:45,080
For that energetic reason,

2865
02:14:45,080 --> 02:14:50,080
I think open networks out-compete close networks typically.

2866
02:14:50,600 --> 02:14:53,640
And in the digital age, that's why I think open,

2867
02:14:53,640 --> 02:14:55,280
that's why internet out-competes intranet

2868
02:14:55,280 --> 02:14:57,320
and that's why open source networks

2869
02:14:57,320 --> 02:14:58,920
are gonna eat closed source networks.

2870
02:14:58,920 --> 02:15:01,240
So what Bitcoin would be in that lens

2871
02:15:01,240 --> 02:15:04,280
is the ultimate open source monetary network,

2872
02:15:04,280 --> 02:15:08,520
devouring closed source central bank monetary networks.

2873
02:15:08,520 --> 02:15:13,520
And I just don't see how there's no possibility

2874
02:15:14,320 --> 02:15:17,640
of unilaterally stopping Bitcoin or destroying it.

2875
02:15:17,640 --> 02:15:21,560
So then they're more likely to regulate or tax it.

2876
02:15:23,440 --> 02:15:25,240
And again, the other fallacy here

2877
02:15:25,240 --> 02:15:26,840
is that a lot of people tend to think of governments

2878
02:15:26,840 --> 02:15:30,800
as these singular indivisible entities

2879
02:15:30,800 --> 02:15:32,960
like they just move under one plan.

2880
02:15:32,960 --> 02:15:35,000
But in reality, it's a lot of people, right?

2881
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:36,920
And a lot of people with loosely coupled interests

2882
02:15:36,920 --> 02:15:38,160
and agendas and whatnot.

2883
02:15:39,720 --> 02:15:44,720
Regulators and others wearing their citizen hat,

2884
02:15:45,680 --> 02:15:47,360
they're gonna see this thing monetizing.

2885
02:15:47,360 --> 02:15:48,680
They're gonna be on the front lines

2886
02:15:48,680 --> 02:15:52,160
of trying to regulate it, trying to control it.

2887
02:15:52,160 --> 02:15:53,520
And I think what's likely to happen

2888
02:15:53,520 --> 02:15:55,640
is they're gonna start to adopt it,

2889
02:15:55,640 --> 02:15:59,520
to buy some of it even as an individual

2890
02:15:59,520 --> 02:16:02,080
or possibly even ultimately at a central bank

2891
02:16:02,080 --> 02:16:03,800
or sovereign wealth fund level

2892
02:16:03,800 --> 02:16:06,080
as an insurance policy against its success.

2893
02:16:07,240 --> 02:16:09,680
And once you start to acquire something

2894
02:16:09,680 --> 02:16:12,800
and then you have a vested economic interest

2895
02:16:12,800 --> 02:16:14,400
in its monetization,

2896
02:16:14,400 --> 02:16:17,600
I think it kind of dissolves any of the power structures

2897
02:16:17,600 --> 02:16:20,560
that are arrayed against it from the inside.

2898
02:16:20,560 --> 02:16:22,760
So I've written a lot about this

2899
02:16:22,760 --> 02:16:24,520
in a new series called Sovereignism,

2900
02:16:24,520 --> 02:16:26,680
which is based loosely on a book

2901
02:16:26,680 --> 02:16:28,800
called The Sovereign Individual.

2902
02:16:28,800 --> 02:16:30,280
And that's the general thesis

2903
02:16:30,280 --> 02:16:33,000
is that microprocessing technology

2904
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:35,800
would devour our organizational models,

2905
02:16:35,800 --> 02:16:38,320
the most important of which is the nation state.

2906
02:16:38,320 --> 02:16:40,000
So I think we're going into this world

2907
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:44,460
where coercion and violence is just much less rewarding.

2908
02:16:47,640 --> 02:16:50,400
The economics of violence are declining

2909
02:16:50,400 --> 02:16:54,520
because of the low cost of protecting property, right?

2910
02:16:54,520 --> 02:16:59,520
You can now protect your monetary property in Bitcoin

2911
02:16:59,740 --> 02:17:02,060
at orders of magnitude less cost

2912
02:17:02,060 --> 02:17:04,280
than is necessary to run a banking network.

2913
02:17:04,280 --> 02:17:09,280
So it changes the way we organize ourselves.

2914
02:17:09,800 --> 02:17:12,520
And again, zooming back to gold

2915
02:17:12,520 --> 02:17:15,000
as kind of the original governor to governments,

2916
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:16,460
where if they manipulated the money,

2917
02:17:16,460 --> 02:17:18,320
gold would leave their country.

2918
02:17:18,320 --> 02:17:21,920
That's why governments have taken

2919
02:17:21,920 --> 02:17:25,580
relatively concerted action to go off of the gold standard.

2920
02:17:25,580 --> 02:17:28,080
There's a great book on this called The Gold Wars

2921
02:17:28,940 --> 02:17:32,160
that outlines how governments have been waging

2922
02:17:32,160 --> 02:17:34,880
a cold war against gold for the past 50 years.

2923
02:17:35,880 --> 02:17:39,280
Bitcoin sort of renews hope

2924
02:17:39,280 --> 02:17:41,640
for that free market governor of governments.

2925
02:17:41,640 --> 02:17:42,900
And that is this digital gold

2926
02:17:42,900 --> 02:17:45,560
that governments cannot stop or co-opt.

2927
02:17:45,560 --> 02:17:47,720
So I think it's something,

2928
02:17:47,720 --> 02:17:49,520
that's why I think it's such a big deal

2929
02:17:49,520 --> 02:17:54,520
is that it is changing,

2930
02:17:54,520 --> 02:17:56,840
it's a new useful fiction, you might say,

2931
02:17:56,840 --> 02:17:58,600
a useful fiction that's superordinate

2932
02:17:58,600 --> 02:18:02,280
to the mythology of the nation state and government

2933
02:18:02,280 --> 02:18:04,280
as the dominant institution in the world.

2934
02:18:04,280 --> 02:18:05,440
Well, I hope you're right

2935
02:18:05,440 --> 02:18:08,960
that all forms of centralized power

2936
02:18:10,440 --> 02:18:12,700
start breaking apart naturally.

2937
02:18:12,700 --> 02:18:15,000
So governments, the more and more power

2938
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:16,560
is given to the individual,

2939
02:18:16,560 --> 02:18:18,440
whatever the technology is,

2940
02:18:18,440 --> 02:18:20,760
and Bitcoin seems to be a promising technology

2941
02:18:20,760 --> 02:18:22,880
that empowers that, enables that,

2942
02:18:22,880 --> 02:18:24,720
that seems to be the trend.

2943
02:18:24,720 --> 02:18:26,360
And that's a promising trend

2944
02:18:26,360 --> 02:18:29,180
from at least from a perspective of somebody

2945
02:18:29,180 --> 02:18:33,440
who values this particular biological meat bag

2946
02:18:33,440 --> 02:18:34,800
that's full of consciousness.

2947
02:18:34,800 --> 02:18:37,720
I think Bitcoin is exposing the greatest scam

2948
02:18:37,720 --> 02:18:40,760
in human history, which is political authority.

2949
02:18:40,760 --> 02:18:43,880
Like who gives anyone the right to be politically,

2950
02:18:43,880 --> 02:18:46,120
have political authority over anyone else?

2951
02:18:46,120 --> 02:18:49,560
People should be free to adopt the rules and systems

2952
02:18:49,560 --> 02:18:52,080
and tools that best suit their needs.

2953
02:18:52,080 --> 02:18:56,200
And that arc of history we covered earlier

2954
02:18:56,200 --> 02:19:01,200
where as socioeconomic systems have become more favorable

2955
02:19:01,920 --> 02:19:03,440
towards individual sovereignty,

2956
02:19:03,440 --> 02:19:06,100
the more wealthy we have become,

2957
02:19:06,100 --> 02:19:07,880
the more we have given the individual,

2958
02:19:07,880 --> 02:19:10,520
we've maximized individual choice,

2959
02:19:10,520 --> 02:19:12,440
the more wealth that society has created

2960
02:19:12,440 --> 02:19:14,460
and the more it has out competed

2961
02:19:14,460 --> 02:19:15,840
the systems that have come before it.

2962
02:19:15,840 --> 02:19:19,360
The latest would be capitalism triumphing over socialism.

2963
02:19:21,040 --> 02:19:23,920
Before maybe we eat, you are in Texas,

2964
02:19:23,920 --> 02:19:25,720
you brought over some brisket.

2965
02:19:25,720 --> 02:19:28,000
Before we maybe indulge in that,

2966
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:31,680
let me bring up one quick topic and then we'll take a break.

2967
02:19:31,680 --> 02:19:35,720
And the topic of what some may term

2968
02:19:35,720 --> 02:19:37,720
the toxicity of the Bitcoin community.

2969
02:19:40,480 --> 02:19:43,200
You've written that Bitcoin toxicity is tough love.

2970
02:19:43,200 --> 02:19:46,640
Do you wanna break that apart a little bit,

2971
02:19:46,640 --> 02:19:51,640
sort of the idea, the philosophy of the toxicity

2972
02:19:52,320 --> 02:19:57,320
that seems to be present in part in the Bitcoin community?

2973
02:19:58,660 --> 02:20:01,420
Yeah, we were talking about this a little bit

2974
02:20:01,420 --> 02:20:04,840
before we recorded and I've been through the gauntlet

2975
02:20:04,840 --> 02:20:06,720
with Bitcoin toxicity as well.

2976
02:20:07,600 --> 02:20:12,600
I came into this space professionally in 2017.

2977
02:20:12,600 --> 02:20:14,160
I was originally running

2978
02:20:14,160 --> 02:20:17,200
a multi-strategy crypto asset hedge fund.

2979
02:20:17,200 --> 02:20:22,200
And my initial investment thesis on the world was that,

2980
02:20:22,400 --> 02:20:23,300
Bitcoin was a big deal,

2981
02:20:23,300 --> 02:20:25,960
but there were all these other exciting coins and projects

2982
02:20:25,960 --> 02:20:28,920
and ways the technology was going to be used.

2983
02:20:28,920 --> 02:20:33,920
And that view of reality met this immune,

2984
02:20:35,460 --> 02:20:38,000
I guess you could say as an ideological immune system,

2985
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:41,000
this Bitcoin toxicity and that it's kind of a filter

2986
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:45,520
that's trying to catch bad or useless

2987
02:20:45,520 --> 02:20:47,800
or even scamming ideas

2988
02:20:47,800 --> 02:20:51,100
that this space is very well known for.

2989
02:20:52,880 --> 02:20:55,200
As we've touched on today, Bitcoin, in my opinion,

2990
02:20:55,200 --> 02:20:57,960
is this world shattering innovation,

2991
02:20:57,960 --> 02:21:01,520
but it's in a sea of the most scammy stuff ever, right?

2992
02:21:01,520 --> 02:21:04,400
People, anybody can go and create a coin.

2993
02:21:05,520 --> 02:21:08,400
So you can go and launch one immediately online

2994
02:21:08,400 --> 02:21:12,900
and you can throw up a website, an advisor page,

2995
02:21:14,080 --> 02:21:15,120
post a white paper talking about

2996
02:21:15,120 --> 02:21:16,560
how great your technology is gonna be

2997
02:21:16,560 --> 02:21:17,680
and how it's gonna change the world.

2998
02:21:17,680 --> 02:21:20,280
And then you can raise $30 million in Bitcoin

2999
02:21:20,280 --> 02:21:22,700
or Ethereum in 30 seconds kind of thing.

3000
02:21:22,700 --> 02:21:27,520
So it's drawn in a lot of this scam artistry, you might say.

3001
02:21:27,520 --> 02:21:31,200
And I think people living through that,

3002
02:21:31,200 --> 02:21:33,560
because there is this natural predilection for people

3003
02:21:33,560 --> 02:21:35,960
when they first come into Bitcoin, you're excited about it,

3004
02:21:35,960 --> 02:21:39,520
then you get lost in the shit coin universe.

3005
02:21:39,520 --> 02:21:43,400
And then just looking at the market success

3006
02:21:43,400 --> 02:21:46,160
of Bitcoin versus, and when I use the word shit coin,

3007
02:21:46,160 --> 02:21:47,120
I'm just-

3008
02:21:47,120 --> 02:21:49,120
You say with all the love in the world.

3009
02:21:49,120 --> 02:21:50,720
All the love in the world.

3010
02:21:50,720 --> 02:21:53,280
I guess you could call me a toxic maximalist in some ways.

3011
02:21:53,280 --> 02:21:55,480
Although I consider myself a freedom maximalist,

3012
02:21:55,480 --> 02:21:56,320
not a Bitcoin maximalist.

3013
02:21:56,320 --> 02:21:57,240
Yeah, I saw that line.

3014
02:21:57,240 --> 02:21:59,800
That's a good line.

3015
02:21:59,800 --> 02:22:03,200
Bitcoin, tracking the market success of Bitcoin

3016
02:22:03,200 --> 02:22:07,480
versus alternative crypto assets, the signal is very clear

3017
02:22:07,480 --> 02:22:09,560
that Bitcoin has out competed all of them.

3018
02:22:09,560 --> 02:22:13,200
So I think that Bitcoin cultural toxicity has evolved

3019
02:22:13,200 --> 02:22:15,720
as an immune response to those bad ideas,

3020
02:22:15,720 --> 02:22:17,880
which is actually, if you think about it,

3021
02:22:17,880 --> 02:22:19,200
kind of is a tough love, right?

3022
02:22:19,200 --> 02:22:22,820
You don't want new entrance to the space to get lost

3023
02:22:22,820 --> 02:22:26,200
in shit coin jungle and learn the hard way,

3024
02:22:26,200 --> 02:22:28,120
the way many Bitcoin maximalists have

3025
02:22:28,120 --> 02:22:31,400
that the real innovation is Bitcoin.

3026
02:22:31,400 --> 02:22:36,400
But like an immune system, I think it can also go too far.

3027
02:22:36,560 --> 02:22:40,920
And so I think it's useful when it is defending the space

3028
02:22:40,920 --> 02:22:43,520
from false narratives, we might say,

3029
02:22:43,520 --> 02:22:48,240
but it becomes detrimental when it's attacking people

3030
02:22:48,240 --> 02:22:50,160
that are inquiring about Bitcoin

3031
02:22:50,160 --> 02:22:52,320
or people that are approaching Bitcoin

3032
02:22:52,320 --> 02:22:54,960
with a good spirit and good intention

3033
02:22:54,960 --> 02:22:57,520
and a desire to learn.

3034
02:22:57,520 --> 02:22:58,440
Because then at that point,

3035
02:22:58,440 --> 02:23:01,760
it's actually impeding the free flow of ideas,

3036
02:23:01,760 --> 02:23:04,620
which the example and your clip

3037
02:23:04,620 --> 02:23:06,520
that was totally taken out of context.

3038
02:23:06,520 --> 02:23:08,000
And then you're literally just saying,

3039
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:09,280
I'm here to learn and contribute.

3040
02:23:09,280 --> 02:23:10,840
I think I've got some stuff to do.

3041
02:23:10,840 --> 02:23:11,920
And then people attack that.

3042
02:23:11,920 --> 02:23:13,960
Like that doesn't make any fucking sense.

3043
02:23:13,960 --> 02:23:16,200
So you're attacking someone who's approaching it

3044
02:23:16,200 --> 02:23:18,440
in a good spirit and asking questions.

3045
02:23:18,440 --> 02:23:21,560
Yeah, and I think sometimes talking about it,

3046
02:23:22,720 --> 02:23:25,640
the toxicity in the Bitcoin community as an immune response

3047
02:23:25,640 --> 02:23:29,600
has a negative effect of giving it a pass

3048
02:23:30,840 --> 02:23:33,800
because like it almost says, look,

3049
02:23:33,800 --> 02:23:36,040
it equates it with the human immune system,

3050
02:23:36,040 --> 02:23:38,720
which seems to do a really good job.

3051
02:23:38,720 --> 02:23:42,600
And so you could say that the toxicity has a lot of features

3052
02:23:42,600 --> 02:23:47,600
in the sea of fraudulent projects

3053
02:23:47,880 --> 02:23:52,280
that steal money from people.

3054
02:23:52,280 --> 02:23:55,840
It's really useful to make sure that you give people

3055
02:23:55,840 --> 02:23:58,640
the harsh truth about who is and isn't a scammer.

3056
02:24:00,120 --> 02:24:02,360
You have to take it apart,

3057
02:24:02,360 --> 02:24:04,560
take it away from that metaphor of the immune system

3058
02:24:04,560 --> 02:24:06,720
and look at basic human nature.

3059
02:24:06,720 --> 02:24:09,280
And human nature can go to some dark places,

3060
02:24:09,280 --> 02:24:14,200
which is, it's sad to say that some people,

3061
02:24:15,320 --> 02:24:20,320
maybe many of us can enjoy for its own sake, the toxicity,

3062
02:24:20,320 --> 02:24:23,360
the toxicity, the mockery, the derision.

3063
02:24:23,360 --> 02:24:28,000
And you stop being part of the immune system

3064
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:31,080
that makes a successful idea propagate

3065
02:24:31,080 --> 02:24:35,200
and start being a sort of a destructive virus yourself.

3066
02:24:35,200 --> 02:24:37,760
And that's something I think about

3067
02:24:37,760 --> 02:24:42,760
because I am new to this particular immune system,

3068
02:24:43,200 --> 02:24:46,040
but I've explored other immune systems

3069
02:24:46,040 --> 02:24:51,040
and I think you understand this world much better than me,

3070
02:24:54,840 --> 02:24:57,760
but I tend to prefer sort of love

3071
02:24:57,760 --> 02:25:00,320
as a mechanism for spreading ideas,

3072
02:25:01,680 --> 02:25:06,200
to err on the side of love and kindness

3073
02:25:06,200 --> 02:25:09,720
and almost like the open-mindedness in a way

3074
02:25:09,720 --> 02:25:13,160
where you're constantly lowering yourself

3075
02:25:13,160 --> 02:25:15,040
in the face of other ideas,

3076
02:25:15,040 --> 02:25:16,840
constantly questioning yourself.

3077
02:25:17,760 --> 02:25:22,760
But I think I understand that that might be more applicable

3078
02:25:24,160 --> 02:25:25,120
in certain contexts,

3079
02:25:25,120 --> 02:25:28,040
like maybe in the space of science or something like that.

3080
02:25:28,040 --> 02:25:31,240
But in the space of Bitcoin, as it currently stands,

3081
02:25:31,240 --> 02:25:33,160
there's so many people that are trying

3082
02:25:33,160 --> 02:25:35,520
to scam others out of their money

3083
02:25:35,520 --> 02:25:38,240
that the kind of harshness required is different.

3084
02:25:39,080 --> 02:25:44,080
Nevertheless, I do want to put it on people like yourself

3085
02:25:44,080 --> 02:25:47,200
and others who I know you wouldn't consider yourself this,

3086
02:25:47,200 --> 02:25:50,400
but you're one of the faces or leaders in this space

3087
02:25:50,400 --> 02:25:52,680
to call people out a little bit,

3088
02:25:52,680 --> 02:25:56,280
to inspire them to be more loving, I suppose.

3089
02:25:56,280 --> 02:25:57,120
But it's difficult

3090
02:25:57,120 --> 02:25:59,400
because you want to walk that line carefully.

3091
02:25:59,400 --> 02:26:02,400
You don't want to be too loving and open-minded.

3092
02:26:02,400 --> 02:26:03,640
Otherwise your brain falls out.

3093
02:26:03,640 --> 02:26:04,480
I get it.

3094
02:26:04,480 --> 02:26:06,120
It's a difficult balance to walk.

3095
02:26:06,120 --> 02:26:10,240
It is subtle and it's nuanced and it is difficult to walk.

3096
02:26:10,240 --> 02:26:13,320
And I think that that's why I try to say tough love

3097
02:26:13,320 --> 02:26:18,320
because when we're young, we may have certain ideas

3098
02:26:18,320 --> 02:26:20,840
about how we, the way we want our life to go,

3099
02:26:20,840 --> 02:26:22,200
but then maybe our parents

3100
02:26:22,200 --> 02:26:24,560
are not letting us do certain things.

3101
02:26:24,560 --> 02:26:26,560
And we think they're, I know when I was a kid,

3102
02:26:26,560 --> 02:26:27,880
I wanted to get my, when I was in fifth grade,

3103
02:26:27,880 --> 02:26:29,480
I wanted to get my ear pierced.

3104
02:26:29,480 --> 02:26:30,840
My mom wouldn't let me do it.

3105
02:26:30,840 --> 02:26:33,720
And I was, oh, come on, mom, I thought it was so cool.

3106
02:26:33,720 --> 02:26:36,000
And then two years later, I'm like, thank you, mom,

3107
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:37,640
for letting me get my ear pierced.

3108
02:26:37,640 --> 02:26:40,840
I think it comes from a place of good intention

3109
02:26:40,840 --> 02:26:45,200
that they are actually, they have asked themselves

3110
02:26:45,200 --> 02:26:46,040
that question, right?

3111
02:26:46,040 --> 02:26:47,920
That they've been inquiring

3112
02:26:47,920 --> 02:26:51,240
and why not this crypto asset or this crypto asset?

3113
02:26:51,240 --> 02:26:52,640
And they've done the exploration.

3114
02:26:52,640 --> 02:26:54,240
They keep coming back to Bitcoin

3115
02:26:54,240 --> 02:26:57,000
and they've seen people being taken advantage of.

3116
02:26:58,800 --> 02:27:03,160
But to your point, it's like, it can,

3117
02:27:03,160 --> 02:27:06,080
this tough love can become detrimental,

3118
02:27:06,080 --> 02:27:08,280
just like the immune system can become detrimental, right?

3119
02:27:08,280 --> 02:27:11,760
It can overreact and it can actually harm the human body.

3120
02:27:11,760 --> 02:27:15,560
So I would say that it's such a tricky and nuanced topic

3121
02:27:15,560 --> 02:27:17,520
that even biology hasn't figured it out, right?

3122
02:27:17,520 --> 02:27:19,360
A lot of people have autoimmune diseases.

3123
02:27:21,360 --> 02:27:24,040
And then there's the other thing that we have this natural,

3124
02:27:24,040 --> 02:27:25,160
I agree with you about love.

3125
02:27:25,160 --> 02:27:28,040
I think love is like the deepest value.

3126
02:27:28,040 --> 02:27:29,920
That's a whole nother philosophical thing,

3127
02:27:29,920 --> 02:27:33,840
but it's, we're biologically programmed

3128
02:27:33,840 --> 02:27:37,080
to pay more attention to things that are adversarial

3129
02:27:37,080 --> 02:27:38,560
or harmful, right?

3130
02:27:38,560 --> 02:27:41,120
That's part of the us protecting the meat suit,

3131
02:27:41,120 --> 02:27:41,960
so to speak.

3132
02:27:41,960 --> 02:27:46,960
So there is some maybe better delivery method

3133
02:27:47,640 --> 02:27:50,600
by being a little bit toxic to really get the point across,

3134
02:27:50,600 --> 02:27:53,200
like, hey, don't get lost over here.

3135
02:27:53,200 --> 02:27:55,200
These things can hurt you.

3136
02:27:55,200 --> 02:27:56,760
Really try to focus on Bitcoin,

3137
02:27:56,760 --> 02:27:59,240
but the toxicity of that message,

3138
02:27:59,240 --> 02:28:00,720
I guess it increases its ability

3139
02:28:00,720 --> 02:28:03,760
to penetrate the individual, but it can also go too far.

3140
02:28:03,760 --> 02:28:04,600
So it is-

3141
02:28:04,600 --> 02:28:08,840
It's interesting, but I almost to push back a little bit,

3142
02:28:08,840 --> 02:28:11,160
toxicity is a funny word.

3143
02:28:11,160 --> 02:28:16,160
I think maybe another way to say it is I brought up

3144
02:28:16,680 --> 02:28:21,040
like Christopher Hitchens is somebody who like, okay,

3145
02:28:21,040 --> 02:28:23,720
you might say it's toxic or something like that,

3146
02:28:23,720 --> 02:28:27,160
because he's basically a intellectual powerhouse

3147
02:28:27,160 --> 02:28:28,800
who's also a troll.

3148
02:28:28,800 --> 02:28:31,240
So he's constantly, it's like guerrilla warfare

3149
02:28:31,240 --> 02:28:33,400
in the space of ideas.

3150
02:28:33,400 --> 02:28:37,040
He's very harsh in his disagreements and criticisms,

3151
02:28:37,040 --> 02:28:42,040
but it's done with incredible grace and skill and poetry.

3152
02:28:42,320 --> 02:28:43,240
So-

3153
02:28:43,240 --> 02:28:44,440
We could use more of that.

3154
02:28:44,440 --> 02:28:45,800
We could use more of that.

3155
02:28:45,800 --> 02:28:48,960
So toxicity just like,

3156
02:28:52,520 --> 02:28:53,560
these are just words.

3157
02:28:53,560 --> 02:28:55,200
They can mean a lot of different things,

3158
02:28:55,200 --> 02:28:59,080
but disagreement doesn't have to be done with love,

3159
02:28:59,920 --> 02:29:02,720
but it should be done with skill

3160
02:29:02,720 --> 02:29:04,360
if it's to be effective.

3161
02:29:04,360 --> 02:29:08,440
So there's a lot of ways to be effective in guerrilla warfare,

3162
02:29:08,440 --> 02:29:10,160
but you want to learn how to shoot

3163
02:29:10,160 --> 02:29:12,840
or whatever the weapon you're using and to do it well.

3164
02:29:12,840 --> 02:29:14,560
Some people do better than others,

3165
02:29:14,560 --> 02:29:17,800
and it's worthwhile to learn to do it well.

3166
02:29:17,800 --> 02:29:20,120
Again, I prefer love, but even love,

3167
02:29:21,200 --> 02:29:25,400
just because you think you're communicating a good idea

3168
02:29:25,400 --> 02:29:26,720
and you very well may be,

3169
02:29:26,720 --> 02:29:28,840
doesn't mean it also doesn't require skill

3170
02:29:28,840 --> 02:29:30,280
to do the communication well.

3171
02:29:30,280 --> 02:29:33,240
Whether it's disagreement and harsh

3172
02:29:33,240 --> 02:29:36,880
or more agreement and loving and so on.

3173
02:29:36,880 --> 02:29:39,880
Yeah, I think very fundamentally

3174
02:29:39,880 --> 02:29:42,160
that all of our decisions,

3175
02:29:42,160 --> 02:29:43,440
you know, we alluded to earlier

3176
02:29:43,440 --> 02:29:45,840
that every decision is an expression of value,

3177
02:29:45,840 --> 02:29:47,160
or every action we take.

3178
02:29:47,160 --> 02:29:49,440
They ultimately come from fear or love.

3179
02:29:49,440 --> 02:29:53,720
Fear would be something much more in the biological domain

3180
02:29:53,720 --> 02:29:56,880
where it's like we're trying to protect ego.

3181
02:29:56,880 --> 02:29:58,480
We're trying to behave selfishly.

3182
02:29:58,480 --> 02:30:01,360
This is the domain of sin, you know?

3183
02:30:01,360 --> 02:30:03,080
I don't know all the sins, gluttony, greed,

3184
02:30:03,080 --> 02:30:05,200
sloth, wrath, lust, pride, envy.

3185
02:30:05,200 --> 02:30:07,720
Like these are all selfish behaviors.

3186
02:30:07,720 --> 02:30:10,960
Whereas something like love is much,

3187
02:30:10,960 --> 02:30:14,520
it's morally superior in that it's more selfless.

3188
02:30:14,520 --> 02:30:16,400
I don't know that we can properly define love

3189
02:30:16,400 --> 02:30:18,520
with words at all, but I would say maybe like

3190
02:30:18,520 --> 02:30:22,720
selfless action could be kind of a generalization of it.

3191
02:30:22,720 --> 02:30:25,680
And that way it is really hard to your point.

3192
02:30:25,680 --> 02:30:30,440
It's hard to love in a world

3193
02:30:30,440 --> 02:30:34,680
that has a lot of conflict that might make you fearful

3194
02:30:34,680 --> 02:30:36,240
if you're really focused on your meat suit.

3195
02:30:36,240 --> 02:30:37,960
But if you're focused on the bigger picture

3196
02:30:37,960 --> 02:30:41,120
and you're focused on others and legacy and life,

3197
02:30:41,120 --> 02:30:43,240
that there is a way to do it.

3198
02:30:43,240 --> 02:30:45,040
And that's why I actually think Christ,

3199
02:30:45,040 --> 02:30:46,800
that is the highest moral aim, right?

3200
02:30:46,800 --> 02:30:50,240
He met all of the vitriol in life, you know,

3201
02:30:50,240 --> 02:30:54,000
betrayal, hate, violence, he met it all with love

3202
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:55,920
and he met it with compassion.

3203
02:30:55,920 --> 02:30:58,440
And that's why, like, regardless of if you believe

3204
02:30:58,440 --> 02:31:01,040
that he actually lived or any of this,

3205
02:31:01,040 --> 02:31:06,040
he is symbolic of the highest moral consciousness possible.

3206
02:31:07,720 --> 02:31:10,240
And, you know, Carl Jung would say that

3207
02:31:10,240 --> 02:31:14,520
that was a suitable alternative to psychoanalysis,

3208
02:31:14,520 --> 02:31:17,000
was actually setting your moral aim higher

3209
02:31:17,000 --> 02:31:19,200
and striving towards it diligently.

3210
02:31:19,200 --> 02:31:22,440
So, I mean, I agree completely.

3211
02:31:22,440 --> 02:31:24,960
We need more of that in the Bitcoin space.

3212
02:31:24,960 --> 02:31:26,440
We need more of that in the world, frankly.

3213
02:31:26,440 --> 02:31:27,440
In the world, yeah.

3214
02:31:28,840 --> 02:31:31,960
And these things, they're all intertwined, you know.

3215
02:31:31,960 --> 02:31:34,320
We touched on the beginning, all of us get to decide,

3216
02:31:34,320 --> 02:31:36,320
but the world does influence kind of

3217
02:31:36,320 --> 02:31:38,080
if we adopt fear or love.

3218
02:31:39,960 --> 02:31:42,200
But it takes, I don't know, it takes good systems

3219
02:31:42,200 --> 02:31:45,520
and it takes, I guess, good leaders to set an example.

3220
02:31:45,520 --> 02:31:48,920
Yeah, I do believe that there's like individual people

3221
02:31:48,920 --> 02:31:50,720
can have a ripple effect.

3222
02:31:50,720 --> 02:31:53,480
That's what I try to do, sort of embody the,

3223
02:31:53,480 --> 02:31:55,040
I'm just one ant.

3224
02:31:55,040 --> 02:31:57,520
But one of the things I have faith in

3225
02:31:57,520 --> 02:32:02,360
is I'm trying to do that more.

3226
02:32:03,360 --> 02:32:04,680
I know this is a podcast,

3227
02:32:04,680 --> 02:32:07,960
but I'm trying to do less talking and more doing.

3228
02:32:10,920 --> 02:32:13,320
I've been disappointed in myself, if I'm being honest,

3229
02:32:13,320 --> 02:32:16,000
how much talking I've been doing, you know,

3230
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:20,200
as opposed to, like in my own private life,

3231
02:32:20,200 --> 02:32:22,160
I live the thing I talk about,

3232
02:32:22,160 --> 02:32:26,200
but I also haven't created much, you know.

3233
02:32:26,200 --> 02:32:30,720
And I believe in the power of individuals that create stuff,

3234
02:32:30,720 --> 02:32:33,520
like create an idea through those individuals

3235
02:32:33,520 --> 02:32:35,760
that try to create something new, the world progresses.

3236
02:32:35,760 --> 02:32:37,160
And hopefully there's more and more,

3237
02:32:37,160 --> 02:32:39,320
more and more of those people.

3238
02:32:39,320 --> 02:32:41,640
So you mentioned kind of people who,

3239
02:32:42,600 --> 02:32:45,080
what the Bitcoin community might call scammers.

3240
02:32:45,080 --> 02:32:50,080
I have a lot of passions in my life

3241
02:32:50,480 --> 02:32:52,760
that I focus a lot of my attention to.

3242
02:32:53,840 --> 02:32:58,840
You know, Bitcoin doesn't happen to be yet one of them.

3243
02:32:59,840 --> 02:33:01,560
Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, you know.

3244
02:33:01,560 --> 02:33:06,560
I'm always looking for things to really fall in love with.

3245
02:33:08,520 --> 02:33:12,880
So how is a person like me supposed to figure out,

3246
02:33:12,880 --> 02:33:16,320
I also happen to have a platform a little bit,

3247
02:33:16,320 --> 02:33:21,320
and how am I supposed to figure out who is interesting,

3248
02:33:21,480 --> 02:33:25,080
what is an interesting set of ideas and what are not?

3249
02:33:25,080 --> 02:33:27,040
Because people are financially tied

3250
02:33:27,040 --> 02:33:28,680
into a lot of the cryptocurrencies

3251
02:33:28,680 --> 02:33:32,040
that we're talking about, certainly with Bitcoin,

3252
02:33:32,040 --> 02:33:35,360
you know, their livelihood, their wellbeing is tied up to it.

3253
02:33:35,360 --> 02:33:37,960
So it becomes much more emotional, much more personal.

3254
02:33:37,960 --> 02:33:41,520
It's no longer purely an exploration of ideas.

3255
02:33:41,520 --> 02:33:44,080
It's really almost like a threat on your property.

3256
02:33:44,080 --> 02:33:45,960
Like it's a personal threat.

3257
02:33:45,960 --> 02:33:47,960
It makes it very difficult to explore those ideas.

3258
02:33:47,960 --> 02:33:50,440
So I understand it, but it makes it very difficult

3259
02:33:50,440 --> 02:33:55,440
for somebody like me to just walk in and be curious.

3260
02:33:55,600 --> 02:33:59,720
So how do I proceed in this difficult world

3261
02:33:59,720 --> 02:34:01,200
in exploring this landscape

3262
02:34:02,280 --> 02:34:07,280
and not give a platform to ideas that may harm others?

3263
02:34:07,280 --> 02:34:12,280
I guess first I'd like to commend your forthrightness

3264
02:34:12,280 --> 02:34:14,520
about this, because I don't think many people

3265
02:34:14,520 --> 02:34:16,480
try to walk that line necessarily.

3266
02:34:16,480 --> 02:34:20,000
People, again, kind of the territorial imperative,

3267
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:23,200
they'll put whoever on, they'll help expand their reach.

3268
02:34:23,200 --> 02:34:24,520
Oh yeah, that's true.

3269
02:34:24,520 --> 02:34:26,920
Or say whatever needs to be said to expand their reach.

3270
02:34:26,920 --> 02:34:29,720
So I think you're coming from a good place, I'll say that.

3271
02:34:31,040 --> 02:34:34,720
There's a great piece written on the topic of scammers

3272
02:34:34,720 --> 02:34:37,640
and scamming, I think it was by Goldstein.

3273
02:34:37,640 --> 02:34:39,920
He wrote a piece called, Everyone's a Scammer.

3274
02:34:39,920 --> 02:34:43,720
And it's sort of back to this general human proclivity

3275
02:34:43,720 --> 02:34:46,000
to try and get something for nothing always.

3276
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:49,280
Which again, it can be positive, it can be innovative,

3277
02:34:49,280 --> 02:34:50,280
or it can be negative.

3278
02:34:50,280 --> 02:34:52,280
It can be trying to steal from people.

3279
02:34:55,480 --> 02:34:59,040
I think that's a useful piece just to kind of see

3280
02:34:59,040 --> 02:35:00,760
the crypto world through that lens.

3281
02:35:00,760 --> 02:35:03,600
And that's how Bitcoiners are able to do that.

3282
02:35:03,600 --> 02:35:06,400
That's how Bitcoiners are thinking all the time.

3283
02:35:06,400 --> 02:35:09,240
They are by nature adversarial thinkers.

3284
02:35:09,240 --> 02:35:12,120
So they're trying to minimize the need for trust

3285
02:35:12,120 --> 02:35:14,920
in any situation and maximize verification.

3286
02:35:17,200 --> 02:35:21,480
As far as sifting through the ideas,

3287
02:35:21,480 --> 02:35:26,400
I guess this is back where the cultural immune system

3288
02:35:26,400 --> 02:35:28,480
has some utility.

3289
02:35:28,480 --> 02:35:30,680
Because there were times when I thought

3290
02:35:30,680 --> 02:35:34,200
this particular crypto asset, Augur was one

3291
02:35:34,200 --> 02:35:36,400
I was really into, that it could facilitate

3292
02:35:36,400 --> 02:35:38,080
prediction markets and prediction markets

3293
02:35:38,080 --> 02:35:41,720
could make markets more efficient, et cetera, et cetera.

3294
02:35:41,720 --> 02:35:46,000
But when that investment thesis basically met

3295
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:49,600
the cultural filter or immune system,

3296
02:35:49,600 --> 02:35:51,800
it forced me to reevaluate my position,

3297
02:35:51,800 --> 02:35:54,320
forced me to really look into it more deeply.

3298
02:35:54,320 --> 02:35:57,360
And through that exploration, I realized that it would need

3299
02:35:57,360 --> 02:36:00,040
to be built on Bitcoin to work basically.

3300
02:36:00,040 --> 02:36:02,760
So, but it really comes down to like you doing

3301
02:36:02,760 --> 02:36:06,000
your homework, but we can't all deeply evaluate

3302
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:08,120
every idea out there, right?

3303
02:36:08,120 --> 02:36:11,520
One of the things I struggle with is Alex Jones,

3304
02:36:11,520 --> 02:36:13,800
for example, had dinner with him.

3305
02:36:16,520 --> 02:36:19,120
I could tell that would be a very fun conversation,

3306
02:36:19,120 --> 02:36:22,920
but like then I also understand that there's

3307
02:36:24,200 --> 02:36:27,880
like consequences to that conversation

3308
02:36:27,880 --> 02:36:30,760
that should be explored with care.

3309
02:36:30,760 --> 02:36:34,120
And so you need to take on the responsibility

3310
02:36:34,120 --> 02:36:35,840
of being a chef or the puffer fish

3311
02:36:35,840 --> 02:36:37,600
and all those kinds of things.

3312
02:36:37,600 --> 02:36:39,600
That said, just like you said,

3313
02:36:39,600 --> 02:36:42,120
it's very difficult to know this ahead of time

3314
02:36:43,400 --> 02:36:46,680
and I will probably make mistakes.

3315
02:36:46,680 --> 02:36:49,920
And that's a shitty thing to have to live with

3316
02:36:49,920 --> 02:36:51,320
that I'm going to make mistakes

3317
02:36:51,320 --> 02:36:52,960
and some of them very large.

3318
02:36:52,960 --> 02:36:57,600
Like, yeah, I mean, I can imagine a bunch of different ways

3319
02:36:57,600 --> 02:36:59,120
but all we can do in this world

3320
02:36:59,120 --> 02:37:00,920
is once we make the mistakes,

3321
02:37:00,920 --> 02:37:02,360
we acknowledge those mistakes.

3322
02:37:02,360 --> 02:37:04,120
Yes, learn.

3323
02:37:04,120 --> 02:37:05,040
And learn.

3324
02:37:05,040 --> 02:37:09,760
And also, I have to put this on the rest of us

3325
02:37:09,760 --> 02:37:14,760
that you don't take one thing that a person did

3326
02:37:15,280 --> 02:37:17,880
and then burn them at the stake for it.

3327
02:37:17,880 --> 02:37:20,640
That you realize that we all make mistakes

3328
02:37:20,640 --> 02:37:23,280
that a particular mistake does not make the person.

3329
02:37:23,280 --> 02:37:27,680
And this applies to taking stuff out of context

3330
02:37:27,680 --> 02:37:30,680
over hundreds of hours of talking,

3331
02:37:30,680 --> 02:37:35,680
but it applies to actual, in context, big mistake.

3332
02:37:37,440 --> 02:37:39,280
So what if I murdered somebody at some point?

3333
02:37:39,280 --> 02:37:40,120
Just give me a break.

3334
02:37:40,120 --> 02:37:42,400
No, there are some things that are too far, of course,

3335
02:37:42,400 --> 02:37:47,160
but in general, we need to give each other a chance.

3336
02:37:47,160 --> 02:37:48,600
Yeah, but I'm still,

3337
02:37:50,480 --> 02:37:52,000
I walk with a heavy heart

3338
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:54,200
knowing that I'll probably make a mistake,

3339
02:37:54,200 --> 02:37:56,600
especially one that I didn't mean to.

3340
02:37:56,600 --> 02:37:58,360
That's the one that worries me most.

3341
02:37:58,360 --> 02:38:00,000
Well, this is human nature.

3342
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:03,960
Like, hamartia, to miss the mark,

3343
02:38:03,960 --> 02:38:05,520
that's the root word of sin.

3344
02:38:05,520 --> 02:38:07,320
We are sinful by nature.

3345
02:38:07,320 --> 02:38:08,360
We can't help it.

3346
02:38:08,360 --> 02:38:11,040
There's no way, again, pain is information, right?

3347
02:38:11,040 --> 02:38:14,580
There's no way to learn other than trying, failing,

3348
02:38:15,480 --> 02:38:19,640
learning, and then you put yourself in better formation,

3349
02:38:19,640 --> 02:38:22,920
right, in formation to better deal with it next time.

3350
02:38:22,920 --> 02:38:26,360
So I hope, I don't get the sense

3351
02:38:26,360 --> 02:38:30,440
that you're actually afraid of making a misstep.

3352
02:38:30,440 --> 02:38:35,080
Like, I think you're just maybe disappointed,

3353
02:38:35,080 --> 02:38:35,920
is a better word.

3354
02:38:35,920 --> 02:38:36,920
Like, you know you're gonna make the mistakes.

3355
02:38:36,920 --> 02:38:39,400
Yeah, that's exactly, that's a much, much better word.

3356
02:38:39,400 --> 02:38:41,120
But we have to embrace that.

3357
02:38:41,120 --> 02:38:41,960
That's the only way anything,

3358
02:38:41,960 --> 02:38:43,920
that's the only way we can advance,

3359
02:38:43,920 --> 02:38:46,720
is that we're dealing with an incomprehensible reality.

3360
02:38:46,720 --> 02:38:48,520
All we can do is throw spaghetti at the wall

3361
02:38:48,520 --> 02:38:49,800
and see what sticks.

3362
02:38:49,800 --> 02:38:50,640
Yeah.

3363
02:38:50,640 --> 02:38:53,080
And in that process, we're all inherently gonna hurt

3364
02:38:53,080 --> 02:38:54,160
ourselves and hurt others,

3365
02:38:54,160 --> 02:38:57,800
and that's where love and forgiveness come into play, right?

3366
02:38:57,800 --> 02:39:02,600
And yeah, I think the other thing is that this culture

3367
02:39:02,600 --> 02:39:05,440
of reducing people down to a label, right?

3368
02:39:05,440 --> 02:39:07,840
Whether it's racism or whether you're calling them a scammer

3369
02:39:07,840 --> 02:39:11,120
or any number of terms,

3370
02:39:11,120 --> 02:39:14,840
you're discounting their sovereignty to zero, right?

3371
02:39:14,840 --> 02:39:19,040
You're taking a super complex human that is vast,

3372
02:39:19,040 --> 02:39:21,960
contains multitudes, is changing over time,

3373
02:39:21,960 --> 02:39:24,560
and you're trying to put them in a bucket of a word.

3374
02:39:25,680 --> 02:39:28,760
And that is just, I think, a cognitive fallacy.

3375
02:39:28,760 --> 02:39:31,200
Like, it's not only gonna hurt the person that you're,

3376
02:39:31,200 --> 02:39:33,040
you know, winnowing down to a word,

3377
02:39:33,040 --> 02:39:34,480
it's also gonna hurt you.

3378
02:39:34,480 --> 02:39:38,920
And it's gonna, in your attempt to decomplexify reality

3379
02:39:38,920 --> 02:39:40,320
by assigning this person to a term,

3380
02:39:40,320 --> 02:39:42,960
you're actually gonna create bad outcomes for yourself

3381
02:39:42,960 --> 02:39:45,240
because you're not gonna understand that person.

3382
02:39:45,240 --> 02:39:46,920
I do also think there's a failure

3383
02:39:46,920 --> 02:39:50,680
of our social media technology that incentivizes

3384
02:39:50,680 --> 02:39:53,160
that kind of reduction to a label.

3385
02:39:53,160 --> 02:39:56,840
It's just the viral nature of that reduction.

3386
02:39:56,840 --> 02:39:59,440
So not only do we humans naturally do that,

3387
02:40:01,160 --> 02:40:06,160
our social media platforms make that easier, more fun,

3388
02:40:07,280 --> 02:40:11,360
more effective to do that at scale, the mass hysteria.

3389
02:40:11,360 --> 02:40:15,600
So I think there's actually, like, technological ways

3390
02:40:15,600 --> 02:40:18,200
of adding friction to that.

3391
02:40:18,200 --> 02:40:20,280
Yeah, I wonder, I mean, I agree with you

3392
02:40:20,280 --> 02:40:22,840
that it's social media is an amplifier

3393
02:40:22,840 --> 02:40:25,880
to our natural, this natural way

3394
02:40:25,880 --> 02:40:27,200
of dealing with one another.

3395
02:40:27,200 --> 02:40:30,520
But I wonder, and my thinking has evolved a lot on this,

3396
02:40:30,520 --> 02:40:32,680
that there's something below the way

3397
02:40:32,680 --> 02:40:35,160
we're treating each other too, right?

3398
02:40:35,160 --> 02:40:37,840
We could say civilization sort of advances

3399
02:40:37,840 --> 02:40:40,120
in the tools we make and the way we treat each other.

3400
02:40:40,120 --> 02:40:42,800
We tend to have better tools, better quality of life,

3401
02:40:42,800 --> 02:40:46,280
and better morality, better quality of living

3402
02:40:46,280 --> 02:40:49,200
and ways of dealing with one another.

3403
02:40:49,200 --> 02:40:53,600
And I think that when you corrupt the money,

3404
02:40:53,600 --> 02:40:56,600
that it really does push us the negative direction,

3405
02:40:56,600 --> 02:41:01,600
pushes us away from, again, encouraging

3406
02:41:02,320 --> 02:41:05,600
or amplifying scarcity artificially

3407
02:41:05,600 --> 02:41:07,520
causes us to be more divisive.

3408
02:41:07,520 --> 02:41:08,720
When things are more divisive,

3409
02:41:08,720 --> 02:41:11,640
we tend to be less civilized, less nuanced,

3410
02:41:11,640 --> 02:41:14,520
more black or white, or this or that,

3411
02:41:14,520 --> 02:41:17,960
or you're this, or you're label A or label B.

3412
02:41:17,960 --> 02:41:20,640
So I really think, and this is a harder one to unravel,

3413
02:41:20,640 --> 02:41:24,000
but I think if we can fix the money, right,

3414
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:26,920
which again is the base layer operating system

3415
02:41:26,920 --> 02:41:29,240
for human moral action in the world,

3416
02:41:30,240 --> 02:41:32,560
that it has downstream effects.

3417
02:41:32,560 --> 02:41:34,440
So we'd actually maybe start to treat each other

3418
02:41:34,440 --> 02:41:36,320
a little better on social media,

3419
02:41:36,320 --> 02:41:41,200
despite the fact that it enables this faster communication.

3420
02:41:41,200 --> 02:41:42,040
That's interesting.

3421
02:41:42,040 --> 02:41:46,560
So perhaps fixing social media, as I've been thinking about,

3422
02:41:46,560 --> 02:41:49,600
is treating the symptom, not the cause.

3423
02:41:49,600 --> 02:41:52,840
Yeah, that is the Bitcoin rabbit hole in a nutshell,

3424
02:41:52,840 --> 02:41:55,000
is that they say fix the money, fix the world.

3425
02:41:55,000 --> 02:41:58,800
You keep tracing these different social malaises

3426
02:41:58,800 --> 02:42:03,800
or technological difficulties, lack of innovation.

3427
02:42:03,840 --> 02:42:06,160
Weinstein's entire Portal podcast,

3428
02:42:06,160 --> 02:42:08,560
something went wrong in the early 70s.

3429
02:42:08,560 --> 02:42:11,200
We went off the gold standard in 1971.

3430
02:42:11,200 --> 02:42:16,000
And there's a great website, wtfhappat1971.com,

3431
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:18,400
goes through this whole gamut of socioeconomic data

3432
02:42:18,400 --> 02:42:22,880
that's completely gone askew since the early 70s.

3433
02:42:22,880 --> 02:42:24,560
Yeah, you had this whole video.

3434
02:42:24,560 --> 02:42:28,520
What do you think about Eric Weinstein and Bitcoin

3435
02:42:29,480 --> 02:42:31,600
and the gold standard?

3436
02:42:31,600 --> 02:42:35,600
Does he, I actually haven't heard him talk about his thesis

3437
02:42:35,600 --> 02:42:38,160
about the 70s in connection

3438
02:42:38,160 --> 02:42:42,080
to the going off of the gold standard.

3439
02:42:42,080 --> 02:42:43,560
Yeah, what are your thoughts there?

3440
02:42:43,560 --> 02:42:46,080
What are your thoughts about his general relationship

3441
02:42:46,080 --> 02:42:49,760
with the Bitcoin idea and the community?

3442
02:42:49,760 --> 02:42:52,940
Yeah, the first exposure I had to Eric was his,

3443
02:42:52,940 --> 02:42:55,440
I think it was his first episode with Peter Thiel.

3444
02:42:55,440 --> 02:42:57,120
And they're going through that thesis

3445
02:42:57,120 --> 02:43:00,980
that there's been this general institutional rot

3446
02:43:00,980 --> 02:43:03,880
and suppression of innovation since the early 70s.

3447
02:43:03,880 --> 02:43:06,000
And he's trying to identify what it is.

3448
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:08,120
I don't think they ever pended on the money

3449
02:43:09,320 --> 02:43:11,300
on going off the gold standard.

3450
02:43:11,300 --> 02:43:14,640
But in recent interactions with Eric,

3451
02:43:14,640 --> 02:43:16,680
I've interacted with him on Clubhouse.

3452
02:43:17,560 --> 02:43:19,960
We recently released an episode of the show

3453
02:43:19,960 --> 02:43:22,080
I did with Chris Espley,

3454
02:43:22,080 --> 02:43:24,320
and it was titled Dear Eric Weinstein.

3455
02:43:24,320 --> 02:43:26,800
So we're going through his worldview

3456
02:43:26,800 --> 02:43:28,000
that he's expressed in the portal

3457
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:31,800
and tying it back to the money in different ways.

3458
02:43:31,800 --> 02:43:33,360
And he's been, he's engaged.

3459
02:43:33,360 --> 02:43:35,240
Eric retweeted the show.

3460
02:43:35,240 --> 02:43:36,760
We've exchanged some messages.

3461
02:43:36,760 --> 02:43:38,380
He's been very open-minded.

3462
02:43:38,380 --> 02:43:40,460
He's asked some really good questions.

3463
02:43:40,460 --> 02:43:42,680
So I get the sense that he's approaching this

3464
02:43:43,740 --> 02:43:45,960
very wholeheartedly.

3465
02:43:45,960 --> 02:43:48,960
He does bring with him his existing worldview

3466
02:43:48,960 --> 02:43:50,280
and his existing theory.

3467
02:43:50,280 --> 02:43:52,160
The one that really blew up was gauge theory.

3468
02:43:52,160 --> 02:43:53,360
They got really popular.

3469
02:43:53,360 --> 02:43:54,880
I don't know a lot about gauge theory.

3470
02:43:54,880 --> 02:43:56,720
I actually messaged Eric and said,

3471
02:43:56,720 --> 02:43:58,160
I want to learn more genuinely,

3472
02:43:58,160 --> 02:44:01,320
because he seems to be serious

3473
02:44:01,320 --> 02:44:04,000
that that needs to be considered in the sphere of money.

3474
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:05,840
And so I want to learn more about it.

3475
02:44:06,840 --> 02:44:08,260
But I think overall it's great.

3476
02:44:08,260 --> 02:44:10,900
It's great to see an intellectual heavyweight

3477
02:44:10,900 --> 02:44:13,740
of his caliber gravitating towards Bitcoin.

3478
02:44:14,760 --> 02:44:19,000
Yeah, he has some gauge theoretic conceptions

3479
02:44:19,000 --> 02:44:23,920
about the world broadly, but also about economics,

3480
02:44:23,920 --> 02:44:27,200
which ultimately boils down to just a set of mathematics,

3481
02:44:27,200 --> 02:44:30,760
which allows you to more effectively reason about the world.

3482
02:44:30,760 --> 02:44:32,780
And he has a certain set of views there.

3483
02:44:33,720 --> 02:44:37,160
So it's fascinating to see him grapple with it.

3484
02:44:37,160 --> 02:44:42,160
I think he's also kind of actually kind of like all of us,

3485
02:44:42,400 --> 02:44:45,840
grappling with the idea of what is Bitcoin in this world.

3486
02:44:45,840 --> 02:44:47,720
It's a very young technology,

3487
02:44:47,720 --> 02:44:52,720
and it's unclear exactly how the ideas of the past

3488
02:44:52,880 --> 02:44:57,520
fit with it and integrate, how the two integrate together.

3489
02:44:57,520 --> 02:44:59,920
And so it's interesting to explore,

3490
02:44:59,920 --> 02:45:01,480
not just Bitcoin in particular.

3491
02:45:01,480 --> 02:45:06,480
So for me, what I've always saw Bitcoin as

3492
02:45:06,880 --> 02:45:11,120
from the beginning, from a narrow worldview

3493
02:45:11,120 --> 02:45:14,560
is computer science, which is where I come from.

3494
02:45:14,560 --> 02:45:16,800
And so I wasn't almost aware

3495
02:45:16,800 --> 02:45:21,680
in the social, political, financial aspects of Bitcoin.

3496
02:45:21,680 --> 02:45:26,480
But now I see that there's not just power,

3497
02:45:26,480 --> 02:45:29,960
but there's fascinating ideas to explore on that side

3498
02:45:29,960 --> 02:45:31,560
of things, not just the computer science,

3499
02:45:31,560 --> 02:45:35,520
not just the technical details, but the political,

3500
02:45:35,520 --> 02:45:38,640
the socioeconomic, the philosophical.

3501
02:45:39,640 --> 02:45:43,040
That's where I find all the fascination in the world,

3502
02:45:43,040 --> 02:45:43,880
frankly.

3503
02:45:45,240 --> 02:45:49,560
One other thing about Weinstein and intellectuals

3504
02:45:49,560 --> 02:45:52,360
more generally that are skeptical of Bitcoin,

3505
02:45:52,360 --> 02:45:54,380
I would challenge them to read the book,

3506
02:45:54,380 --> 02:45:57,520
Human Action, written by Mises.

3507
02:45:57,520 --> 02:46:00,320
I think in 1949, he published the English version.

3508
02:46:01,420 --> 02:46:04,860
It's essentially the Bible of Austrian economics.

3509
02:46:04,860 --> 02:46:09,660
And I think Austrian economics is a noticeable gap

3510
02:46:09,660 --> 02:46:13,800
in most modern intellectuals' worldviews,

3511
02:46:13,800 --> 02:46:15,280
that it's not taught in school.

3512
02:46:15,280 --> 02:46:17,600
I mean, I have a master's degree in accounting and finance,

3513
02:46:17,600 --> 02:46:19,300
studied a lot of economics in school.

3514
02:46:19,300 --> 02:46:21,400
There's not one peep of Austrian econ.

3515
02:46:21,400 --> 02:46:26,400
The least we'd love talking about all the degrees he has.

3516
02:46:26,520 --> 02:46:28,720
I was a CPA, all these things.

3517
02:46:30,280 --> 02:46:35,280
But that curriculum that we get in college

3518
02:46:35,580 --> 02:46:38,720
is noticeably deficient in Austrian economics.

3519
02:46:38,720 --> 02:46:40,520
And I think there's a reason why, right?

3520
02:46:40,520 --> 02:46:43,320
It's heavily government-influenced.

3521
02:46:45,240 --> 02:46:46,680
Again, master's degree in accounting,

3522
02:46:46,680 --> 02:46:48,720
they never taught me about what money is

3523
02:46:48,720 --> 02:46:50,040
or where money comes from.

3524
02:46:50,040 --> 02:46:53,840
All you learn is that the central bank issues money

3525
02:46:53,840 --> 02:46:56,040
and the central bank takes money away.

3526
02:46:56,040 --> 02:46:58,820
So it's conceived of in the textbooks

3527
02:46:58,820 --> 02:47:00,600
quite literally as God, right?

3528
02:47:00,600 --> 02:47:03,760
An entity that suffers no opportunity cost,

3529
02:47:03,760 --> 02:47:06,840
that basically is the foundation

3530
02:47:06,840 --> 02:47:09,120
of the entire Keynesian worldview

3531
02:47:09,120 --> 02:47:10,940
that you're taught in economics.

3532
02:47:10,940 --> 02:47:14,880
And Austrian economics is the opposite end

3533
02:47:14,880 --> 02:47:16,120
of the spectrum of that, right?

3534
02:47:16,120 --> 02:47:18,460
It's actually the culmination,

3535
02:47:18,460 --> 02:47:20,780
which economics is the youngest science in the world,

3536
02:47:20,780 --> 02:47:21,620
by the way.

3537
02:47:21,620 --> 02:47:25,000
So it is kind of the front,

3538
02:47:25,000 --> 02:47:27,040
it's the frontiers of science in many ways,

3539
02:47:27,040 --> 02:47:29,520
like to actually, when I say praxeology,

3540
02:47:29,520 --> 02:47:31,320
many people have never even heard of that.

3541
02:47:31,320 --> 02:47:35,880
But it's something, it's an a priori study

3542
02:47:35,880 --> 02:47:37,400
equivalent to something like mathematics,

3543
02:47:37,400 --> 02:47:39,600
that you're building things from first principles

3544
02:47:39,600 --> 02:47:42,440
to reason about economic reality.

3545
02:47:42,440 --> 02:47:46,420
And I think that book, it's a very difficult book

3546
02:47:46,420 --> 02:47:49,840
written by Mises, 1200 pages, translated from German.

3547
02:47:49,840 --> 02:47:52,880
The way he wields English is fascinating and terrifying

3548
02:47:52,880 --> 02:47:54,000
all at the same time.

3549
02:47:54,960 --> 02:47:56,560
It'd probably take you six months to read it

3550
02:47:56,560 --> 02:47:58,120
if you read it daily, seriously.

3551
02:47:58,120 --> 02:48:00,500
Like it's a beast of a book.

3552
02:48:00,500 --> 02:48:04,420
But that will plug the gap, I think in most,

3553
02:48:04,420 --> 02:48:06,160
any intellectual that's skeptical about Bitcoin,

3554
02:48:06,160 --> 02:48:07,400
I think that will plug the gap

3555
02:48:07,400 --> 02:48:10,380
that's necessary for you to see it in a new light.

3556
02:48:10,380 --> 02:48:12,640
Well, I'll take that as a challenge.

3557
02:48:12,640 --> 02:48:14,480
Now that we took a little bit of a break,

3558
02:48:14,480 --> 02:48:16,520
ate some good Texas brisket, thank you for that,

3559
02:48:16,520 --> 02:48:17,720
by the way, for passing over.

3560
02:48:17,720 --> 02:48:18,920
Quite welcome.

3561
02:48:18,920 --> 02:48:21,600
Let me ask the ridiculous question.

3562
02:48:21,600 --> 02:48:25,480
At the core of the idea of Bitcoin is this guy

3563
02:48:25,480 --> 02:48:28,400
or this entity named Satoshi Nakamoto.

3564
02:48:28,400 --> 02:48:32,280
So the ridiculous question is who is Satoshi Nakamoto?

3565
02:48:32,280 --> 02:48:33,800
And first of all, is it you?

3566
02:48:35,160 --> 02:48:36,000
It's not me.

3567
02:48:37,460 --> 02:48:38,300
I wish.

3568
02:48:38,300 --> 02:48:41,800
And is this an interesting question?

3569
02:48:41,800 --> 02:48:43,500
Or is it just something about our human nature

3570
02:48:43,500 --> 02:48:47,160
that wants to, that always tends towards mystery?

3571
02:48:47,160 --> 02:48:50,620
Well, as we've touched on a bit today,

3572
02:48:51,640 --> 02:48:53,820
you know, mythology, in my opinion,

3573
02:48:53,820 --> 02:48:57,400
is something that is intrinsic to how we see the world

3574
02:48:57,400 --> 02:48:58,240
in a lot of ways.

3575
02:48:58,240 --> 02:49:00,800
Like it's how, it's kind of the structure

3576
02:49:02,240 --> 02:49:04,440
by which we build these useful fictions.

3577
02:49:05,480 --> 02:49:08,280
And so in that way, you could just say that

3578
02:49:08,280 --> 02:49:11,840
Satoshi is the godhead of Bitcoin, effectively.

3579
02:49:11,840 --> 02:49:15,560
And I think a compelling argument could be made

3580
02:49:15,560 --> 02:49:18,040
that his disappearance is what really solidifies

3581
02:49:18,040 --> 02:49:20,160
Bitcoin's decentralization.

3582
02:49:20,160 --> 02:49:25,160
Because if there were one individual to personally vilify

3583
02:49:25,440 --> 02:49:30,380
or denigrate or attack, you know, to disparage

3584
02:49:30,380 --> 02:49:33,560
or question the motives of, you know,

3585
02:49:33,560 --> 02:49:37,780
if he's out on the Hollywood Hills partying,

3586
02:49:37,780 --> 02:49:40,520
everyone knows he's got a million Bitcoin, you know,

3587
02:49:40,520 --> 02:49:43,520
it would just kind of tarnish the entire project

3588
02:49:43,520 --> 02:49:44,360
in a lot of ways.

3589
02:49:44,360 --> 02:49:48,140
But the fact that on that theme, something for nothing,

3590
02:49:48,140 --> 02:49:51,160
this guy actually gave humanity something for nothing.

3591
02:49:51,160 --> 02:49:56,160
And it appears that he didn't profit in any way.

3592
02:49:56,800 --> 02:49:58,260
He, she, or they.

3593
02:49:59,440 --> 02:50:01,840
I actually heard recently that he identified as a he

3594
02:50:01,840 --> 02:50:03,120
in some of his communications.

3595
02:50:03,120 --> 02:50:04,740
So it sounds like it is a he.

3596
02:50:04,740 --> 02:50:09,740
So like his communication is being like studied,

3597
02:50:11,100 --> 02:50:14,500
like almost like exactly as if he is a religious.

3598
02:50:14,500 --> 02:50:15,600
That's right.

3599
02:50:15,600 --> 02:50:16,640
Like a prophet.

3600
02:50:18,460 --> 02:50:23,460
It's fascinating to imagine that he's still alive

3601
02:50:24,440 --> 02:50:27,300
and living in this world.

3602
02:50:27,300 --> 02:50:29,180
And it's even more fascinating to imagine

3603
02:50:29,180 --> 02:50:32,260
that he's perhaps participating in the Bitcoin community

3604
02:50:32,260 --> 02:50:36,820
because I mean, that takes a special human being

3605
02:50:36,820 --> 02:50:41,460
to out of principle do that, to do, to remain anonymous.

3606
02:50:41,460 --> 02:50:43,500
That's very much the George Washington.

3607
02:50:43,500 --> 02:50:46,500
I always wonder like how many people are like that?

3608
02:50:46,500 --> 02:50:48,920
There's a cliche that like absolute power corrupts,

3609
02:50:48,920 --> 02:50:51,420
absolutely, like power corrupts.

3610
02:50:51,420 --> 02:50:55,020
But it seems like the progress of humanity depends

3611
02:50:55,020 --> 02:50:57,940
on the people whom power doesn't corrupt.

3612
02:50:57,940 --> 02:51:02,780
And it's enough to have just a small selection of those.

3613
02:51:04,380 --> 02:51:09,380
And even if most of us are too weak, we're given to power.

3614
02:51:09,540 --> 02:51:14,060
If given the chance, all it takes is a few.

3615
02:51:14,060 --> 02:51:15,580
That's, I've never thought of it like that,

3616
02:51:15,580 --> 02:51:18,340
but Marcus Aurelius immediately came to mind.

3617
02:51:18,340 --> 02:51:21,820
You know, the guy that he had the keys to the kingdom

3618
02:51:21,820 --> 02:51:26,320
and he apparently adhered to the stoic virtues

3619
02:51:26,320 --> 02:51:30,140
until the end, but yeah, I agree with Satoshi.

3620
02:51:30,140 --> 02:51:35,140
The other thing that's interesting is he would be by far

3621
02:51:35,500 --> 02:51:39,980
the most wealthy person in the world on a liquid asset basis

3622
02:51:39,980 --> 02:51:42,220
because he has a million Bitcoin,

3623
02:51:42,220 --> 02:51:47,220
which is 60 billion liquid net worth at current prices.

3624
02:51:47,860 --> 02:51:51,620
So if he is still alive and just operating in the world,

3625
02:51:51,620 --> 02:51:56,180
he is daily and moment to moment resisting massive

3626
02:51:56,180 --> 02:52:01,180
incentives to go and just be the richest guy in the world.

3627
02:52:01,180 --> 02:52:02,740
He's the ultimate hodler.

3628
02:52:02,740 --> 02:52:03,580
Yeah.

3629
02:52:03,580 --> 02:52:05,060
Yeah.

3630
02:52:05,060 --> 02:52:07,740
I mean, so it's, I mean, it's turning down

3631
02:52:07,740 --> 02:52:12,280
not just financial success, but also fame.

3632
02:52:12,280 --> 02:52:14,140
I mean, fame is another drug.

3633
02:52:14,140 --> 02:52:17,340
It's kind of power, but it's in itself is also a drug,

3634
02:52:17,340 --> 02:52:20,540
especially in this modern society, in this attention.

3635
02:52:20,540 --> 02:52:21,660
And he would have both.

3636
02:52:21,660 --> 02:52:22,900
He would have both.

3637
02:52:22,900 --> 02:52:25,780
It's fun to imagine who it could be.

3638
02:52:25,780 --> 02:52:27,900
It's fascinating if it's somebody like you

3639
02:52:27,900 --> 02:52:30,620
or somebody like Elon or somebody like that.

3640
02:52:30,620 --> 02:52:31,940
That's fascinating to think about.

3641
02:52:31,940 --> 02:52:34,660
I think Elon would be hilarious if he came out

3642
02:52:34,660 --> 02:52:37,320
and he was Satoshi, like, hey guys,

3643
02:52:37,320 --> 02:52:38,920
I know I'm already the richest guy in the world,

3644
02:52:38,920 --> 02:52:41,500
but I gotta go ahead and double my lead here.

3645
02:52:42,500 --> 02:52:46,460
What do you make of Elon Musk investing with Tesla,

3646
02:52:46,460 --> 02:52:50,420
investing in Bitcoin and maybe broaden it out

3647
02:52:50,420 --> 02:52:54,700
in some of these other, you know,

3648
02:52:54,700 --> 02:52:58,020
big billionaires, but also people tied to major companies

3649
02:52:58,020 --> 02:52:59,980
investing in Bitcoin?

3650
02:52:59,980 --> 02:53:04,080
Yeah, I think Michael Saylor really led the charge on that.

3651
02:53:04,940 --> 02:53:08,940
He's the CEO of MicroStrategy that I think they've acquired

3652
02:53:08,940 --> 02:53:11,080
upwards of $2 billion in Bitcoin now,

3653
02:53:11,080 --> 02:53:14,860
sort of acquiring August, maybe of 2020.

3654
02:53:16,000 --> 02:53:19,100
And he's, you know, personally bought a lot of it.

3655
02:53:19,100 --> 02:53:22,560
He bought a lot as a treasury reserve asset

3656
02:53:22,560 --> 02:53:24,220
for his company, MicroStrategy.

3657
02:53:24,220 --> 02:53:27,540
Then they leveraged up on a convertible note

3658
02:53:27,540 --> 02:53:28,380
and bought more.

3659
02:53:28,380 --> 02:53:32,400
So he's really gone, really leading the charge

3660
02:53:32,400 --> 02:53:36,020
in this Bitcoin institutional adoption.

3661
02:53:36,020 --> 02:53:38,180
Your conversation with him is a really interesting one.

3662
02:53:38,180 --> 02:53:41,860
Your series of, I mean, series of episodes I suppose,

3663
02:53:41,860 --> 02:53:44,300
but it's only a couple of conversations, I guess.

3664
02:53:44,300 --> 02:53:48,260
Yeah, we recorded twice, five and a half hours each.

3665
02:53:48,260 --> 02:53:50,220
So it's about 11 hours of content.

3666
02:53:50,220 --> 02:53:51,060
Yeah, thank you.

3667
02:53:51,060 --> 02:53:55,220
A lot of people have said that it's the best

3668
02:53:55,220 --> 02:53:57,380
first principle thing they've ever seen on Bitcoin,

3669
02:53:57,380 --> 02:53:59,360
which I take no credit for that at all.

3670
02:53:59,360 --> 02:54:02,620
I mean, I just sat down with a guy and unleashed him.

3671
02:54:02,620 --> 02:54:04,100
He's just a beast.

3672
02:54:04,100 --> 02:54:09,100
Yeah, but it's fascinating that his long-term vision

3673
02:54:10,640 --> 02:54:14,800
with it, I mean, I'm not sure I'm all philosophically

3674
02:54:14,800 --> 02:54:19,800
bought in, but if he's right, if this set of ideas

3675
02:54:19,800 --> 02:54:24,160
are as powerful as he describes, as you describe,

3676
02:54:24,160 --> 02:54:27,600
that this would change the world, which as you say,

3677
02:54:27,600 --> 02:54:29,880
it's funny that a company like MicroStrategy

3678
02:54:31,300 --> 02:54:36,300
might be the company that has the biggest macro effect

3679
02:54:38,100 --> 02:54:40,200
on our economy, on our world.

3680
02:54:40,200 --> 02:54:44,440
Yeah, the conversation reshaped my worldview a lot too

3681
02:54:44,440 --> 02:54:48,160
because he framed money as energy,

3682
02:54:48,160 --> 02:54:50,980
which I had often thought of money as time.

3683
02:54:50,980 --> 02:54:53,520
And it explored those connections a lot in my writing,

3684
02:54:53,520 --> 02:54:57,320
but looking at it as energy, and then his supposition

3685
02:54:57,320 --> 02:55:02,040
that the purpose of life is to basically channel energy

3686
02:55:02,040 --> 02:55:03,160
across space and time.

3687
02:55:03,160 --> 02:55:05,160
So we're just trying to figure out how to channel

3688
02:55:05,160 --> 02:55:07,160
more energy across space and time

3689
02:55:07,160 --> 02:55:08,920
toward the satisfaction of aims.

3690
02:55:09,960 --> 02:55:12,680
And his definition, or his answer to that question,

3691
02:55:12,680 --> 02:55:15,360
what is money, is that money is the highest form of energy

3692
02:55:15,360 --> 02:55:17,160
a human being can channel.

3693
02:55:17,160 --> 02:55:19,480
So it's a claim to all other forms of energy

3694
02:55:19,480 --> 02:55:20,840
we can manifest in the world.

3695
02:55:20,840 --> 02:55:24,960
And that just completely reshaped how I see it,

3696
02:55:24,960 --> 02:55:26,320
brought in this whole other side

3697
02:55:26,320 --> 02:55:30,840
to my intellectual explorations of money.

3698
02:55:30,840 --> 02:55:32,200
Can you elaborate on that a little bit?

3699
02:55:32,200 --> 02:55:34,320
So I understand money is time,

3700
02:55:34,320 --> 02:55:37,140
which in itself is a really powerful idea,

3701
02:55:37,140 --> 02:55:40,000
but money is energy, and channeling energy,

3702
02:55:40,000 --> 02:55:40,840
can you break that apart?

3703
02:55:40,840 --> 02:55:45,000
Yeah, so I guess I definitely have to check out

3704
02:55:45,000 --> 02:55:47,040
the whole series to really get his perspective,

3705
02:55:47,040 --> 02:55:49,480
but I'll do my best to condense it.

3706
02:55:51,360 --> 02:55:55,020
Life itself, all forms of life are,

3707
02:55:55,020 --> 02:55:56,540
they're dependent on energy, right?

3708
02:55:56,540 --> 02:56:00,560
Energy fuels everything, fuels life in action and motion

3709
02:56:00,560 --> 02:56:01,400
and all of that.

3710
02:56:02,400 --> 02:56:05,080
And we could say that maybe like a plant

3711
02:56:06,240 --> 02:56:09,040
is harnessing solar energy

3712
02:56:09,040 --> 02:56:11,880
and then reallocating that into growth.

3713
02:56:11,880 --> 02:56:15,280
So its aim is to grow towards the sun, right?

3714
02:56:15,280 --> 02:56:17,680
So it's allocating energy towards its goal

3715
02:56:17,680 --> 02:56:20,800
of harnessing more solar energy kind of thing.

3716
02:56:20,800 --> 02:56:25,800
So, and humans too have evolved

3717
02:56:27,260 --> 02:56:30,600
to figure out how to harness energy in different ways

3718
02:56:30,600 --> 02:56:35,200
to satisfy higher and more complicated aims.

3719
02:56:35,200 --> 02:56:37,600
So the original energy network

3720
02:56:38,720 --> 02:56:41,240
that he referenced was fire, right?

3721
02:56:41,240 --> 02:56:45,720
We actually learned to wield fire as a tool in and of itself.

3722
02:56:45,720 --> 02:56:48,160
So not only are we learning to channel energy,

3723
02:56:48,160 --> 02:56:51,380
but we're actually learning how to isolate energy

3724
02:56:51,380 --> 02:56:53,840
as a tool in and of itself.

3725
02:56:53,840 --> 02:56:55,000
And so we went into that,

3726
02:56:55,000 --> 02:56:59,680
how harnessing fire had changed human beings.

3727
02:56:59,680 --> 02:57:04,120
And actually, this is one of the earliest examples too

3728
02:57:04,120 --> 02:57:07,640
of a co-evolution between tool and our biology,

3729
02:57:07,640 --> 02:57:11,520
because when we developed fire, we developed cooking

3730
02:57:11,520 --> 02:57:13,120
and cooking is, you can kind of think of it

3731
02:57:13,120 --> 02:57:14,480
as pre-digestion in a way.

3732
02:57:14,480 --> 02:57:16,260
We're liberating these macronutrients

3733
02:57:16,260 --> 02:57:18,380
or making things that otherwise

3734
02:57:18,380 --> 02:57:20,960
would not be digestible, edible.

3735
02:57:21,960 --> 02:57:23,280
And it increases the efficiency

3736
02:57:23,280 --> 02:57:26,160
by which we extract nutrients from food.

3737
02:57:26,160 --> 02:57:27,500
That's what cooking does.

3738
02:57:27,500 --> 02:57:29,860
So when we figured out cooking,

3739
02:57:29,860 --> 02:57:33,600
we liberated all these digestive resources

3740
02:57:33,600 --> 02:57:36,620
that were reallocated towards higher cognitive development.

3741
02:57:36,620 --> 02:57:39,640
So there's this evolutionary path

3742
02:57:39,640 --> 02:57:42,820
between figuring out fire and us becoming smarter,

3743
02:57:42,820 --> 02:57:44,060
which is interesting.

3744
02:57:45,880 --> 02:57:47,720
Some other early examples he gave,

3745
02:57:47,720 --> 02:57:50,360
he went into were missiles and hydraulics.

3746
02:57:51,700 --> 02:57:56,660
So missiles being, we learned to hunt at a distance.

3747
02:57:56,660 --> 02:57:58,920
We can't bring down a wooly mammoth,

3748
02:57:58,920 --> 02:58:03,920
maybe with spears and up close and personal force,

3749
02:58:03,920 --> 02:58:06,360
but we could with spears and javelins

3750
02:58:06,360 --> 02:58:07,880
and slings and whatnot.

3751
02:58:07,880 --> 02:58:11,900
And then he went into how we've used water

3752
02:58:11,900 --> 02:58:13,280
to channel hydraulic energy.

3753
02:58:13,280 --> 02:58:14,920
So we can basically overcome gravity.

3754
02:58:14,920 --> 02:58:19,920
We can move, there's theories that the pyramids

3755
02:58:20,320 --> 02:58:22,680
were constructed using the blocks removed

3756
02:58:22,680 --> 02:58:25,600
using hydraulic energy or using water.

3757
02:58:25,600 --> 02:58:28,040
Clearly we use like cargo ships and whatnot

3758
02:58:28,040 --> 02:58:30,280
to move things much more efficiently across water

3759
02:58:30,280 --> 02:58:32,440
than we could the land.

3760
02:58:32,440 --> 02:58:37,440
So his whole view is how we keep figuring out better ways

3761
02:58:37,600 --> 02:58:40,600
and more efficient ways to harness energy and channel it.

3762
02:58:40,600 --> 02:58:45,600
And in that perspective, money has always represented

3763
02:58:46,880 --> 02:58:49,040
a claim on all other forms of energy.

3764
02:58:49,040 --> 02:58:51,960
So whatever energy couldn't be channeled

3765
02:58:51,960 --> 02:58:54,880
towards something useful in the economy historically

3766
02:58:54,880 --> 02:58:56,260
would go into gold mining.

3767
02:58:56,260 --> 02:58:59,640
So gold became this residual, this economic,

3768
02:58:59,640 --> 02:59:04,120
this token of the excess energy created

3769
02:59:04,120 --> 02:59:05,560
by the market economy.

3770
02:59:05,560 --> 02:59:07,480
And then you could take that token of energy

3771
02:59:07,480 --> 02:59:10,680
and use it to redeem for any other form of energy

3772
02:59:10,680 --> 02:59:13,600
or any other products of energy itself.

3773
02:59:13,600 --> 02:59:18,080
So it's, I guess it's my best approximation of it.

3774
02:59:18,080 --> 02:59:22,320
And it just really shattered my worldview again,

3775
02:59:22,320 --> 02:59:23,800
because I'd always thought about it as time.

3776
02:59:23,800 --> 02:59:26,620
Like we spend time sacrificing to obtain money

3777
02:59:26,620 --> 02:59:28,680
that we then redeem for commencement sacrifices

3778
02:59:28,680 --> 02:59:32,440
from others, but I'd never considered it purely as energy.

3779
02:59:32,440 --> 02:59:34,300
And then it also ties back into gold

3780
02:59:35,300 --> 02:59:38,980
where there was an energy expenditure necessary

3781
02:59:38,980 --> 02:59:40,280
to obtain gold.

3782
02:59:40,280 --> 02:59:43,720
So there's a proof of work associated with obtaining gold

3783
02:59:43,720 --> 02:59:46,120
that protected its market value, right?

3784
02:59:46,120 --> 02:59:47,840
So you had to expend, again,

3785
02:59:47,840 --> 02:59:50,240
if market value of gold's 2000 an ounce,

3786
02:59:50,240 --> 02:59:53,200
you had to expend 1900 an ounce mining.

3787
02:59:53,200 --> 02:59:56,600
So it kept producers honest in a way.

3788
02:59:56,600 --> 02:59:59,000
So do you think something like proof of stake

3789
02:59:59,000 --> 03:00:02,000
that's more about reputation

3790
03:00:02,000 --> 03:00:07,000
than actual exertion, like energy can work?

3791
03:00:10,240 --> 03:00:13,700
No, I think proof of stake is inherently centralizing.

3792
03:00:15,520 --> 03:00:18,400
It's like the old Matthew principle,

3793
03:00:18,400 --> 03:00:20,960
from those who have to those who have,

3794
03:00:20,960 --> 03:00:22,920
more will be given from those who have not,

3795
03:00:22,920 --> 03:00:24,160
everything will be taken.

3796
03:00:24,160 --> 03:00:26,480
That's what proof of stake is.

3797
03:00:26,480 --> 03:00:29,920
You need proof of work to embody skin in the game

3798
03:00:29,920 --> 03:00:33,640
in the marketplace, such that contributions

3799
03:00:33,640 --> 03:00:36,480
are commensurate with consideration received.

3800
03:00:36,480 --> 03:00:37,960
That's how systems work.

3801
03:00:39,460 --> 03:00:42,880
What's the idea why proof of work might

3802
03:00:44,960 --> 03:00:47,040
incentivize decentralization?

3803
03:00:49,660 --> 03:00:53,280
Do you worry that as Bitcoin becomes more powerful,

3804
03:00:53,280 --> 03:00:56,840
it may become, again, more centralized?

3805
03:00:56,840 --> 03:00:59,600
Well, the decentralization of Bitcoin

3806
03:01:01,000 --> 03:01:03,800
is largely driven by the nodes, actually,

3807
03:01:03,800 --> 03:01:05,320
which aren't actually mining.

3808
03:01:05,320 --> 03:01:07,880
They're just choosing which rule set to implement.

3809
03:01:10,680 --> 03:01:12,120
And then the mining network

3810
03:01:12,120 --> 03:01:14,600
is actually enforcing that rule set.

3811
03:01:14,600 --> 03:01:17,680
So I think the mining network

3812
03:01:19,600 --> 03:01:22,200
is inherently decentralized in that

3813
03:01:22,200 --> 03:01:24,600
really anyone with access to cheap energy

3814
03:01:24,600 --> 03:01:25,640
can become a miner.

3815
03:01:25,640 --> 03:01:27,920
You can freely enter or exit the market

3816
03:01:27,920 --> 03:01:29,360
or the network at any time.

3817
03:01:30,920 --> 03:01:34,840
But maintaining the block size at a manageable level

3818
03:01:34,840 --> 03:01:38,080
is what's key to maintaining node decentralization.

3819
03:01:38,080 --> 03:01:39,640
That's an interesting question.

3820
03:01:40,600 --> 03:01:41,720
Who do you think has more power,

3821
03:01:41,720 --> 03:01:43,180
the miners or the nodes?

3822
03:01:44,360 --> 03:01:49,360
Because the nodes carry the idea of the protocol,

3823
03:01:49,360 --> 03:01:53,760
like the specifics, so in some sense,

3824
03:01:53,760 --> 03:01:56,980
they have more power if Bitcoin is an idea.

3825
03:01:58,560 --> 03:02:00,760
They're kind of mutually indispensable though

3826
03:02:00,760 --> 03:02:01,980
because you can't have,

3827
03:02:03,820 --> 03:02:06,000
there's no security without the miners.

3828
03:02:06,000 --> 03:02:08,520
So without the miners, Bitcoin is just an idea.

3829
03:02:08,520 --> 03:02:12,220
And the idea of Bitcoin is maybe existed

3830
03:02:12,220 --> 03:02:13,320
even before Bitcoin, right?

3831
03:02:13,320 --> 03:02:14,140
Just sound money.

3832
03:02:14,140 --> 03:02:15,900
We just say sound money as an idea.

3833
03:02:15,900 --> 03:02:19,000
But there was no way to root that

3834
03:02:19,000 --> 03:02:20,720
into thermodynamic reality

3835
03:02:20,720 --> 03:02:25,160
without Satoshi figuring out not just proof of work,

3836
03:02:25,160 --> 03:02:28,480
it's the entire composite of the difficulty adjustment,

3837
03:02:28,480 --> 03:02:32,820
proof of work, one-way hashing, et cetera.

3838
03:02:32,820 --> 03:02:34,200
So I don't know.

3839
03:02:34,200 --> 03:02:37,380
That's hard to say, hard to disentangle the two.

3840
03:02:37,380 --> 03:02:40,220
You've talked about money as morality too.

3841
03:02:41,440 --> 03:02:44,600
How do you think about moral and immoral action

3842
03:02:44,600 --> 03:02:45,860
in the context of money?

3843
03:02:47,400 --> 03:02:51,080
There's this great quote by Rothbard,

3844
03:02:51,080 --> 03:02:53,800
who's a famous Austrian economist.

3845
03:02:53,800 --> 03:02:54,640
And he says, quote,

3846
03:02:54,640 --> 03:02:59,640
to be moral, an act must be free, unquote.

3847
03:03:00,920 --> 03:03:05,920
And I think morality, it changes over time

3848
03:03:05,920 --> 03:03:12,920
and it has its roots in biology.

3849
03:03:12,920 --> 03:03:14,320
Jordan Peterson makes the point

3850
03:03:14,320 --> 03:03:18,320
that even animals have their own sort of pseudo morality,

3851
03:03:18,320 --> 03:03:21,800
where like with wolf packs, for instance,

3852
03:03:21,800 --> 03:03:24,400
if there's a dispute between the alpha males,

3853
03:03:24,400 --> 03:03:28,280
or I guess between an alpha male and a incumbent,

3854
03:03:28,280 --> 03:03:33,040
the two males will have a fight basically.

3855
03:03:33,040 --> 03:03:34,840
And then when the alpha male is killed,

3856
03:03:34,840 --> 03:03:39,520
basically, and then when it's decided that one has won,

3857
03:03:39,520 --> 03:03:40,920
the loser will basically roll over

3858
03:03:40,920 --> 03:03:45,040
and give up his neck to the alpha male.

3859
03:03:45,040 --> 03:03:47,840
And they do this instead of fighting to the death,

3860
03:03:47,840 --> 03:03:51,080
because in a wolf pack, they need every wolf

3861
03:03:51,080 --> 03:03:52,680
so they can go out and bring down,

3862
03:03:52,680 --> 03:03:55,000
you never know when you're gonna need the 20th wolf

3863
03:03:55,000 --> 03:03:57,040
to bring down the big Buffalo the next day or whatever.

3864
03:03:57,040 --> 03:04:01,360
So they've developed this less than fight to the death,

3865
03:04:01,360 --> 03:04:05,680
social morality to optimize their effectiveness as a wolf pack.

3866
03:04:07,920 --> 03:04:12,080
And similarly for humans, our morality sort of emerges

3867
03:04:13,240 --> 03:04:16,200
through competition and play even.

3868
03:04:16,200 --> 03:04:19,960
There are these implicit rules that come into place

3869
03:04:19,960 --> 03:04:22,840
based on how we're organizing ourselves over time.

3870
03:04:26,920 --> 03:04:29,440
So with money, it's interesting

3871
03:04:29,440 --> 03:04:33,560
because most tools we would consider to be amoral,

3872
03:04:34,480 --> 03:04:38,160
as in a hammer can be used to build a house,

3873
03:04:38,160 --> 03:04:39,400
which could be seen to be good,

3874
03:04:39,400 --> 03:04:40,880
like a good constructive purpose,

3875
03:04:40,880 --> 03:04:43,160
or it could be used to bash someone's skull,

3876
03:04:43,160 --> 03:04:44,720
which could be something evil.

3877
03:04:46,040 --> 03:04:49,480
And that the tool itself is amoral,

3878
03:04:49,480 --> 03:04:51,600
doesn't have any independent morality of its own.

3879
03:04:51,600 --> 03:04:54,120
All of the morality is associated

3880
03:04:54,120 --> 03:04:55,480
with the wielder of the tool.

3881
03:04:55,480 --> 03:04:57,440
So what's the quote?

3882
03:04:57,440 --> 03:04:59,640
Like any tool can be a weapon if you hold it right,

3883
03:04:59,640 --> 03:05:00,480
sort of thing.

3884
03:05:01,520 --> 03:05:05,040
But money's maybe a little bit different

3885
03:05:05,040 --> 03:05:10,040
in that when you monopolize money,

3886
03:05:11,920 --> 03:05:15,320
it's only useful as a tool for one thing.

3887
03:05:15,320 --> 03:05:17,880
And that's for allocating wealth away from some

3888
03:05:17,880 --> 03:05:19,480
and to others.

3889
03:05:19,480 --> 03:05:23,680
So it is the only utility of monopolized money is theft.

3890
03:05:23,680 --> 03:05:28,280
There's no other, there's a lot of propaganda out there

3891
03:05:28,280 --> 03:05:29,720
that will say, oh, we need to print money

3892
03:05:29,720 --> 03:05:34,400
to get out of this disaster or to give to the poor,

3893
03:05:34,400 --> 03:05:39,400
whatever moralistically camouflaged political aim

3894
03:05:40,320 --> 03:05:44,360
is being discussed, the base layer of monopolized money

3895
03:05:44,360 --> 03:05:46,400
is that it's only useful for taking from some

3896
03:05:46,400 --> 03:05:47,880
and giving to others.

3897
03:05:47,880 --> 03:05:51,560
So another way to think about this is that money

3898
03:05:51,560 --> 03:05:55,200
is a paper claim on the savings of society.

3899
03:05:55,200 --> 03:05:58,200
So it is just a ticket for redeeming savings,

3900
03:05:58,200 --> 03:06:00,920
which could be time, could be capital,

3901
03:06:00,920 --> 03:06:03,640
could be knowledge from any market actor in the world.

3902
03:06:04,640 --> 03:06:06,880
So it's kind of a list of who owns what,

3903
03:06:06,880 --> 03:06:08,160
if you will, it's a proxy list.

3904
03:06:08,160 --> 03:06:11,240
If there's one group that can amend that list

3905
03:06:11,240 --> 03:06:14,760
and others cannot, then they're basically able

3906
03:06:14,760 --> 03:06:18,960
and incented to modify that list to their own benefit.

3907
03:06:18,960 --> 03:06:23,080
And that's effectively what a central bank is doing.

3908
03:06:23,080 --> 03:06:27,120
So a central bank is determining how much money to create.

3909
03:06:27,120 --> 03:06:28,760
They're also determining who gets to receive

3910
03:06:28,760 --> 03:06:30,520
that money first.

3911
03:06:30,520 --> 03:06:33,120
And the first recipients of that money

3912
03:06:33,120 --> 03:06:37,320
are gonna be the beneficiaries in an inflationary regime.

3913
03:06:37,320 --> 03:06:39,080
So those that receive the money last

3914
03:06:39,080 --> 03:06:40,640
are the ones being robbed.

3915
03:06:40,640 --> 03:06:41,800
Those that receive the money first

3916
03:06:41,800 --> 03:06:46,600
are the ones that are receiving the stolen proceeds,

3917
03:06:46,600 --> 03:06:47,440
let's say.

3918
03:06:47,440 --> 03:06:52,440
And this has a really corrosive effect on social morality

3919
03:06:54,320 --> 03:06:59,320
because if we consider that people's time horizon,

3920
03:07:00,800 --> 03:07:02,800
which the Austrians call the time preference,

3921
03:07:03,840 --> 03:07:06,880
the more short-term thinking you are,

3922
03:07:06,880 --> 03:07:11,640
the more likely you are to engage in selfish behavior.

3923
03:07:11,640 --> 03:07:15,480
All right, if you know that it's all over tomorrow,

3924
03:07:15,480 --> 03:07:16,680
and you've been working your whole life

3925
03:07:16,680 --> 03:07:20,240
to develop this business or create this reputation

3926
03:07:20,240 --> 03:07:21,080
or whatever your thing is,

3927
03:07:21,080 --> 03:07:22,800
but you just are given the foreknowledge

3928
03:07:22,800 --> 03:07:24,720
that tomorrow it's all gonna end,

3929
03:07:24,720 --> 03:07:26,400
you're much more likely to go out

3930
03:07:26,400 --> 03:07:28,400
and just maybe get drunk and party that night

3931
03:07:28,400 --> 03:07:30,800
because there's no more repercussions, right?

3932
03:07:32,000 --> 03:07:35,360
Whereas if you know that you're gonna live

3933
03:07:35,360 --> 03:07:37,800
for a very long time,

3934
03:07:37,800 --> 03:07:40,200
you're much more likely to plan for the future.

3935
03:07:40,200 --> 03:07:44,560
And money's very, so we just say that your time horizon

3936
03:07:44,560 --> 03:07:47,160
is closely related to your morality, right?

3937
03:07:47,160 --> 03:07:48,720
The longer term thinking you are,

3938
03:07:48,720 --> 03:07:50,560
the more moral you would tend to behave,

3939
03:07:50,560 --> 03:07:53,080
the more you would care about long-term relationship building

3940
03:07:53,080 --> 03:07:55,560
versus going out and getting wasted.

3941
03:07:55,560 --> 03:08:00,560
And money too impinges very closely on our time preference.

3942
03:08:01,640 --> 03:08:03,280
And again, time preference is the Austrian term.

3943
03:08:03,280 --> 03:08:07,040
So low time preference means you're long-term oriented,

3944
03:08:07,040 --> 03:08:10,160
high time preference means you're short-term oriented,

3945
03:08:10,160 --> 03:08:11,880
which can be a little trippy for some people

3946
03:08:11,880 --> 03:08:13,000
because it sounds backwards.

3947
03:08:13,000 --> 03:08:18,000
But if your money constantly loses value,

3948
03:08:19,920 --> 03:08:24,160
you are incentivized to become more short-term oriented.

3949
03:08:24,160 --> 03:08:28,520
You are handicapped in your ability to plan for the future

3950
03:08:28,520 --> 03:08:32,720
because your money, which is intended to be,

3951
03:08:32,720 --> 03:08:34,000
here's another definition of money,

3952
03:08:34,000 --> 03:08:36,920
as an insurance policy against uncertainty.

3953
03:08:36,920 --> 03:08:39,080
So no matter what problems you encounter in the world,

3954
03:08:39,080 --> 03:08:42,480
this money will best help you deal with those problems.

3955
03:08:43,520 --> 03:08:45,720
When that insurance policy against uncertainty

3956
03:08:45,720 --> 03:08:48,040
is injected with uncertainty,

3957
03:08:48,040 --> 03:08:50,560
it's polluted with the uncertainty of inflation,

3958
03:08:50,560 --> 03:08:52,040
your time horizon shrinks,

3959
03:08:52,040 --> 03:08:54,240
your ability to plan long-term shrinks.

3960
03:08:55,240 --> 03:08:57,240
And this impinges on social morality.

3961
03:08:57,240 --> 03:09:00,480
So there's a great book on this called Honest Money

3962
03:09:00,480 --> 03:09:01,320
by Gary North,

3963
03:09:01,320 --> 03:09:05,160
and in that book, he gives the parable of the wine maker.

3964
03:09:06,360 --> 03:09:09,480
And the wine maker, if we just imagine

3965
03:09:09,480 --> 03:09:12,400
the hypothetical wine maker operating a business

3966
03:09:12,400 --> 03:09:14,440
in a centrally banked economy,

3967
03:09:14,440 --> 03:09:17,240
and let's say his central bank just doubled the money supply

3968
03:09:17,240 --> 03:09:19,320
to quote unquote, save the economy,

3969
03:09:20,440 --> 03:09:23,440
say an increase in money supply from one to $2 trillion.

3970
03:09:23,440 --> 03:09:25,760
This wine maker that's accustomed to selling wine

3971
03:09:25,760 --> 03:09:28,920
at $20 a bottle is now faced with the same problem

3972
03:09:28,920 --> 03:09:31,840
that the wine maker that's accustomed to selling wine

3973
03:09:31,840 --> 03:09:35,240
at $20 a bottle is now faced with basically three choices.

3974
03:09:39,160 --> 03:09:40,720
And an important point here too,

3975
03:09:40,720 --> 03:09:42,160
before we get into his three choices,

3976
03:09:42,160 --> 03:09:44,000
are what prices are themselves.

3977
03:09:44,000 --> 03:09:48,720
Prices are the most visible aspect of any service.

3978
03:09:48,720 --> 03:09:50,680
So when you increase prices,

3979
03:09:51,680 --> 03:09:54,840
you are incentivizing your customers to look elsewhere.

3980
03:09:54,840 --> 03:09:56,080
They're gonna look at your competition.

3981
03:09:56,080 --> 03:09:57,840
When you decrease prices,

3982
03:09:57,840 --> 03:09:59,200
closer at your product, right?

3983
03:09:59,200 --> 03:10:02,120
You're delivering a solution at a lower price.

3984
03:10:02,120 --> 03:10:04,440
So this wine maker that's accustomed to selling his wine

3985
03:10:04,440 --> 03:10:07,280
at a $20 price point, all of a sudden,

3986
03:10:07,280 --> 03:10:09,920
because of a central bank has tripled the money supply,

3987
03:10:09,920 --> 03:10:11,080
he has three choices.

3988
03:10:12,120 --> 03:10:16,520
He can either keep selling his bottle at $20,

3989
03:10:16,520 --> 03:10:19,520
and all of his inputs will increase due to inflation

3990
03:10:19,520 --> 03:10:23,920
by 50%, so he will lose 50% of his profit margin

3991
03:10:23,920 --> 03:10:24,800
as a result.

3992
03:10:24,800 --> 03:10:26,760
So he can choose to eat that loss.

3993
03:10:26,760 --> 03:10:29,040
He can choose to double the selling price

3994
03:10:29,040 --> 03:10:32,040
of his bottle of wine from $20 to $40,

3995
03:10:32,040 --> 03:10:34,400
because all of the price of his inputs doubled,

3996
03:10:34,400 --> 03:10:36,600
so then he would maintain his profit margin.

3997
03:10:37,720 --> 03:10:41,120
Or the third one is that he could choose

3998
03:10:41,120 --> 03:10:45,800
to water down his wine or use inferior ingredients.

3999
03:10:45,800 --> 03:10:47,800
So he could use cheaper inputs

4000
03:10:47,800 --> 03:10:50,440
and maintain the output at the same price.

4001
03:10:52,120 --> 03:10:54,320
So he could basically start selling at $20

4002
03:10:54,320 --> 03:10:56,920
and basically start selling his customers

4003
03:10:56,920 --> 03:10:58,480
an inferior product for the same price

4004
03:10:58,480 --> 03:11:00,040
to preserve his profit margin.

4005
03:11:01,040 --> 03:11:04,560
Now again, case number one, it's not very palatable.

4006
03:11:04,560 --> 03:11:06,400
He doesn't wanna eat the economic loss.

4007
03:11:06,400 --> 03:11:08,720
Case number two, it's not very good either,

4008
03:11:08,720 --> 03:11:11,040
because he's then incentivizing all of his customers

4009
03:11:11,040 --> 03:11:14,600
to go shop other winemakers if he doubles his price.

4010
03:11:14,600 --> 03:11:16,960
So human nature being what it is,

4011
03:11:16,960 --> 03:11:18,960
trying to get something for nothing,

4012
03:11:18,960 --> 03:11:21,720
inflation actually seeps into other industries

4013
03:11:21,720 --> 03:11:24,840
encouraging producers into option three,

4014
03:11:24,840 --> 03:11:28,200
which is to deceive your customer in the short run.

4015
03:11:28,200 --> 03:11:31,120
And again, this would be done initially at the margins.

4016
03:11:31,120 --> 03:11:32,560
Maybe it's just a few drops of water.

4017
03:11:32,560 --> 03:11:35,360
Maybe it's just some cheaper grapes.

4018
03:11:35,360 --> 03:11:40,360
But over time, this inflation is actually inducing producers

4019
03:11:42,640 --> 03:11:45,440
to weigh their financial wellbeing

4020
03:11:45,440 --> 03:11:47,440
against their moral integrity.

4021
03:11:47,440 --> 03:11:49,840
So it's forcing them into this dilemma

4022
03:11:49,840 --> 03:11:52,440
that would not exist in a free market economy.

4023
03:11:53,320 --> 03:11:58,320
And as they charge more money for wine that is inferior,

4024
03:11:59,040 --> 03:12:01,640
the buyers of that wine also living

4025
03:12:01,640 --> 03:12:04,280
in a central banked economy are also getting scammed

4026
03:12:04,280 --> 03:12:06,560
by not only the inflation, but also the wine.

4027
03:12:06,560 --> 03:12:09,240
So it becomes this kind of corrosive,

4028
03:12:09,240 --> 03:12:11,080
contagious moral effect

4029
03:12:12,400 --> 03:12:14,960
that propagates throughout an economy.

4030
03:12:14,960 --> 03:12:18,640
And that's why I've argued in a lot of my writing

4031
03:12:18,640 --> 03:12:23,360
that inflation is this infectious moral cancer on the world.

4032
03:12:24,240 --> 03:12:29,240
I think it is tied back to a lot of the social strangeness

4033
03:12:31,000 --> 03:12:32,600
we've seen in modern times,

4034
03:12:32,600 --> 03:12:36,000
where there seems to be a lot of fake people

4035
03:12:36,000 --> 03:12:38,160
and a lot of fake businesses and a lot of scams,

4036
03:12:38,160 --> 03:12:39,000
all of these things.

4037
03:12:39,000 --> 03:12:41,080
I think it really is rooted in the money.

4038
03:12:41,080 --> 03:12:45,240
And Bitcoin as the first money in history

4039
03:12:45,240 --> 03:12:47,480
that has a 0% terminal inflation rate,

4040
03:12:47,480 --> 03:12:50,520
or said differently, zero unexpected inflation.

4041
03:12:50,520 --> 03:12:54,360
There's no theft integrated into Bitcoin.

4042
03:12:54,360 --> 03:12:56,040
You can only earn it through work

4043
03:12:56,040 --> 03:12:58,320
or sacrificing resources to obtain it.

4044
03:12:59,760 --> 03:13:03,800
It is the antidote to this moral cancer

4045
03:13:03,800 --> 03:13:06,160
that inflation riddles our society with.

4046
03:13:07,080 --> 03:13:08,840
Again, you're blowing my mind a little bit

4047
03:13:08,840 --> 03:13:11,880
to think about the ripple effects of inflation,

4048
03:13:11,880 --> 03:13:15,160
the way it seeps through with our interactions.

4049
03:13:15,160 --> 03:13:18,600
So at the very, the early ripples

4050
03:13:18,600 --> 03:13:20,440
is the effect it has on the products,

4051
03:13:20,440 --> 03:13:23,120
on the dilution of the wine.

4052
03:13:23,120 --> 03:13:27,200
But also it might have ripple effects on the character,

4053
03:13:27,200 --> 03:13:28,720
on the behavior of people.

4054
03:13:30,240 --> 03:13:33,360
That's interesting, artificial creation of scarcity,

4055
03:13:33,360 --> 03:13:38,360
creating, having effects on society at the social,

4056
03:13:38,680 --> 03:13:40,240
like the social fabric.

4057
03:13:40,240 --> 03:13:42,280
And I guess you're arguing the morality.

4058
03:13:42,280 --> 03:13:45,920
Yeah, it's perverting free market dynamics,

4059
03:13:45,920 --> 03:13:48,960
which again, we said free markets generate pragmatic truth.

4060
03:13:48,960 --> 03:13:51,960
So inflation distorts price signals,

4061
03:13:51,960 --> 03:13:54,920
which means it confuses capital allocation.

4062
03:13:54,920 --> 03:13:56,240
So we're trying to solve problems,

4063
03:13:56,240 --> 03:13:58,080
but all of a sudden we can't tell

4064
03:13:58,080 --> 03:13:59,520
if this price increase is a matter

4065
03:13:59,520 --> 03:14:01,600
of true supply and demand change

4066
03:14:01,600 --> 03:14:03,480
or a matter of policy change.

4067
03:14:03,480 --> 03:14:07,160
So it clouds our economic perceptions.

4068
03:14:07,160 --> 03:14:09,360
It suppresses innovation,

4069
03:14:09,360 --> 03:14:11,080
because now you've exacerbated

4070
03:14:11,080 --> 03:14:12,480
the boom and bust business cycle.

4071
03:14:12,480 --> 03:14:14,920
People are gonna overborrow and go into projects

4072
03:14:14,920 --> 03:14:16,800
that they can't profitably sustain.

4073
03:14:16,800 --> 03:14:18,320
So then there'll be a huge collapse.

4074
03:14:18,320 --> 03:14:22,240
So that actually breaks the market's function

4075
03:14:22,240 --> 03:14:24,040
of generating innovation.

4076
03:14:24,040 --> 03:14:25,200
And then, yeah, I would argue too,

4077
03:14:25,200 --> 03:14:29,560
that it pollutes our pursuit of virtue, let's say.

4078
03:14:29,560 --> 03:14:33,280
Maybe it's pushing back, but I don't think so.

4079
03:14:33,280 --> 03:14:34,840
It's not as clear to me,

4080
03:14:34,840 --> 03:14:36,840
perhaps because I haven't thought about it deeply,

4081
03:14:36,840 --> 03:14:41,840
that money is core to life and human interaction,

4082
03:14:43,320 --> 03:14:45,640
because there might be other forces,

4083
03:14:45,640 --> 03:14:47,240
other fraudulent forces,

4084
03:14:47,240 --> 03:14:48,920
other things in human nature

4085
03:14:48,920 --> 03:14:51,240
that are creating these effects as well.

4086
03:14:51,240 --> 03:14:53,360
So it's clear, I think you're articulating really well

4087
03:14:53,360 --> 03:14:56,240
that there's these negative effects from inflation.

4088
03:14:56,240 --> 03:14:59,080
I wonder if there's other undiscovered,

4089
03:14:59,080 --> 03:15:02,360
not undiscovered, but ones we're not making explicit now,

4090
03:15:02,360 --> 03:15:07,360
forces that are creating all the things we're seeing now

4091
03:15:08,640 --> 03:15:11,520
with, like you said, cancel culture and all those things,

4092
03:15:11,520 --> 03:15:16,520
but also the negative effects on the quality of products,

4093
03:15:16,960 --> 03:15:20,400
on the excellence of the creativity and the innovation,

4094
03:15:20,400 --> 03:15:21,240
all those kinds of things.

4095
03:15:21,240 --> 03:15:23,200
I wonder if there's other factors.

4096
03:15:23,200 --> 03:15:26,800
It's kind of, listen, it's compelling to think money's

4097
03:15:26,800 --> 03:15:28,400
at the core of it all.

4098
03:15:28,400 --> 03:15:30,560
Like if you fix, I forgot what the phrase was.

4099
03:15:30,560 --> 03:15:32,440
Fix the money, fix the world.

4100
03:15:32,440 --> 03:15:33,520
Yeah, fix the money, fix the world.

4101
03:15:33,520 --> 03:15:37,720
That, again, things that sound good,

4102
03:15:37,720 --> 03:15:40,520
I'm skeptical of by nature.

4103
03:15:40,520 --> 03:15:44,480
So I wonder if there's other things that are beyond money

4104
03:15:44,480 --> 03:15:47,320
that are somehow deeply integrated into our human nature.

4105
03:15:47,320 --> 03:15:51,640
Another one related to money is social cohesion itself.

4106
03:15:51,640 --> 03:15:56,640
So very simple anecdote for this was the more you increase

4107
03:15:56,640 --> 03:16:01,120
the inflation rate, social cohesion is inversely

4108
03:16:01,120 --> 03:16:02,120
proportionate to that.

4109
03:16:02,120 --> 03:16:04,640
So the extreme example would be hyperinflation, right?

4110
03:16:04,640 --> 03:16:07,280
Where the money is produced in such excess

4111
03:16:07,280 --> 03:16:09,800
that it loses all meaning and relevance.

4112
03:16:09,800 --> 03:16:14,400
So today in Venezuela, there is cash clogging the gutters,

4113
03:16:14,400 --> 03:16:16,680
clogging the streets, clogging the sewer system

4114
03:16:17,680 --> 03:16:21,160
because the cash has lost all relevance.

4115
03:16:21,160 --> 03:16:23,960
And so anecdotally, we would suspect that, okay,

4116
03:16:23,960 --> 03:16:27,080
if there's a inverse relationship

4117
03:16:27,080 --> 03:16:29,960
between inflation and social cohesion,

4118
03:16:29,960 --> 03:16:32,680
if we could then take inflation to zero,

4119
03:16:32,680 --> 03:16:34,520
couldn't we theoretically increase

4120
03:16:34,520 --> 03:16:36,960
social cohesion to its maximum?

4121
03:16:38,640 --> 03:16:40,600
So another way to say that is inflation

4122
03:16:40,600 --> 03:16:44,000
is a de-civilizing force.

4123
03:16:44,000 --> 03:16:45,760
Whereas natural price deflation,

4124
03:16:45,760 --> 03:16:48,600
which would occur in a hard money economy

4125
03:16:48,600 --> 03:16:51,040
where there's either a fixed supply of Bitcoin

4126
03:16:51,040 --> 03:16:56,040
or a relatively scarce supply of gold, for instance,

4127
03:16:56,200 --> 03:17:00,280
that lays claim to an increasing capital stock

4128
03:17:00,280 --> 03:17:01,920
of goods and services,

4129
03:17:01,920 --> 03:17:04,080
prices would naturally decline every year

4130
03:17:04,080 --> 03:17:06,120
as we became smarter.

4131
03:17:06,120 --> 03:17:07,840
So the market price becomes a reflection

4132
03:17:07,840 --> 03:17:09,840
of our collective knowledge.

4133
03:17:09,840 --> 03:17:12,680
So by letting prices decline naturally over time,

4134
03:17:12,680 --> 03:17:16,120
we can actually induce civilization.

4135
03:17:16,120 --> 03:17:18,640
But by trying to force prices higher all the time

4136
03:17:18,640 --> 03:17:21,920
via the central bank, we're creating the opposite effect.

4137
03:17:21,920 --> 03:17:24,200
So we talked a little bit about the Soviet Union

4138
03:17:24,200 --> 03:17:26,400
and I happened to have lived through the collapse

4139
03:17:26,400 --> 03:17:27,520
of the Soviet Union.

4140
03:17:28,800 --> 03:17:33,800
And so what are the factors, the causes in your mind

4141
03:17:34,680 --> 03:17:36,920
to why the Soviet Union collapsed?

4142
03:17:38,320 --> 03:17:42,960
So definitely a multivariate situation.

4143
03:17:42,960 --> 03:17:45,200
I think there's a lot of factors.

4144
03:17:45,200 --> 03:17:48,920
One that jumped out to me recently,

4145
03:17:48,920 --> 03:17:51,480
again, from that documentary that I didn't note before

4146
03:17:51,480 --> 03:17:54,120
was that at one point Stalin eliminated,

4147
03:17:54,120 --> 03:17:56,960
I think 75% of his intelligence force,

4148
03:17:59,440 --> 03:18:01,320
which I think when you're competing

4149
03:18:01,320 --> 03:18:05,240
with another nation state and intelligence

4150
03:18:05,240 --> 03:18:08,840
and covert operations are very integral to your survival,

4151
03:18:08,840 --> 03:18:13,600
I think that was definitely a shot in the foot.

4152
03:18:13,600 --> 03:18:18,600
But at a higher level, I would say that capitalism

4153
03:18:19,840 --> 03:18:23,680
and communism were each resource strategies

4154
03:18:23,680 --> 03:18:25,640
of the 20th century nation state.

4155
03:18:27,760 --> 03:18:30,120
And they seem, we commonly consider them

4156
03:18:30,120 --> 03:18:31,480
to be diametrically opposed,

4157
03:18:31,480 --> 03:18:34,800
but there's actually a lot of commonality between the two.

4158
03:18:34,800 --> 03:18:38,280
The difference would be that in Soviet Russia,

4159
03:18:39,320 --> 03:18:40,480
as we alluded to earlier,

4160
03:18:40,480 --> 03:18:43,560
they tried to completely replace price signals

4161
03:18:44,720 --> 03:18:46,840
with this nationalistic faith and devotion.

4162
03:18:46,840 --> 03:18:50,640
So they removed the economic nerve signal,

4163
03:18:50,640 --> 03:18:53,720
which coordinated the allocation of capital over time.

4164
03:18:53,720 --> 03:18:57,000
So this inhibited their ability to generate wealth.

4165
03:18:57,000 --> 03:18:58,240
Whereas in the United States,

4166
03:18:58,240 --> 03:19:02,360
we left most markets open to free enterprise.

4167
03:19:02,360 --> 03:19:06,080
So we honored the integrity of price signals

4168
03:19:06,080 --> 03:19:11,080
and we allowed people to trade and accumulate wealth.

4169
03:19:11,680 --> 03:19:14,600
So in every market, except the market for money,

4170
03:19:14,600 --> 03:19:18,280
both markets maintained a central bank as we've gotten to.

4171
03:19:18,280 --> 03:19:23,080
So I think in a really big picture standpoint,

4172
03:19:23,080 --> 03:19:27,560
that's why capitalism out competes communism

4173
03:19:27,560 --> 03:19:31,240
is because it is able to generate more wealth

4174
03:19:31,240 --> 03:19:32,960
than communism was,

4175
03:19:32,960 --> 03:19:35,600
and therefore was able to put financial pressure

4176
03:19:35,600 --> 03:19:39,320
on the USSR until it reached the point of bankruptcy,

4177
03:19:39,320 --> 03:19:40,160
essentially.

4178
03:19:41,160 --> 03:19:44,120
A similar model, I would argue,

4179
03:19:44,120 --> 03:19:48,560
is that for the same reasons we saw

4180
03:19:48,560 --> 03:19:50,080
capitalism out compete communism,

4181
03:19:50,080 --> 03:19:53,880
which I think the data that I recall

4182
03:19:53,880 --> 03:19:56,600
was that the USSR's economy was valued

4183
03:19:56,600 --> 03:19:59,640
at close to one third of its inputs.

4184
03:19:59,640 --> 03:20:02,840
So if you just didn't do anything inside the USSR

4185
03:20:02,840 --> 03:20:05,360
and just sold all the raw materials that were going into it,

4186
03:20:05,360 --> 03:20:07,920
it would have been worth three times as much

4187
03:20:07,920 --> 03:20:09,800
as sending the materials in,

4188
03:20:09,800 --> 03:20:10,920
running it through the efforts,

4189
03:20:10,920 --> 03:20:12,320
and then shipping things back out.

4190
03:20:12,320 --> 03:20:16,240
It was value destructive versus value creative.

4191
03:20:16,240 --> 03:20:18,560
And I would argue this is because,

4192
03:20:18,560 --> 03:20:21,440
again, the centralized computing model

4193
03:20:21,440 --> 03:20:23,360
versus decentralized computing model,

4194
03:20:23,360 --> 03:20:26,160
it just became more and more corrupt over time.

4195
03:20:27,800 --> 03:20:30,920
It got to the point where I think most of the occupations

4196
03:20:30,920 --> 03:20:34,200
in USSR towards the end were as informants, right?

4197
03:20:34,200 --> 03:20:35,800
They were working for the state.

4198
03:20:37,200 --> 03:20:38,520
Jordan Peterson makes this point too,

4199
03:20:38,520 --> 03:20:40,600
that at some point it was actually illegal

4200
03:20:40,600 --> 03:20:43,160
to be sad in Soviet Russia.

4201
03:20:43,160 --> 03:20:45,000
Because if you were sad,

4202
03:20:45,000 --> 03:20:48,920
you were contradicting the utopian view of the state.

4203
03:20:48,920 --> 03:20:49,760
So if you were sad,

4204
03:20:49,760 --> 03:20:52,000
you're implying the state's not doing something wrong.

4205
03:20:52,000 --> 03:20:53,720
But by the way, this does remind me,

4206
03:20:53,720 --> 03:20:57,200
do you know what Jordan Peterson thinks about Bitcoin

4207
03:20:57,200 --> 03:21:02,200
and about the future impact of Bitcoin on the society?

4208
03:21:02,200 --> 03:21:04,160
No, I don't, actually.

4209
03:21:05,560 --> 03:21:09,200
We're hopefully gonna be talking to him soon about that.

4210
03:21:09,200 --> 03:21:12,760
We did a book club on his book, Maps of Meaning,

4211
03:21:12,760 --> 03:21:14,720
and he engaged with us about it.

4212
03:21:14,720 --> 03:21:17,760
So we're hoping to deliver the orange bill to Mr. Peterson.

4213
03:21:17,760 --> 03:21:18,600
The orange bill.

4214
03:21:18,600 --> 03:21:22,600
I think his audience is one of the most important audiences

4215
03:21:22,600 --> 03:21:23,960
in the world to understand Bitcoin.

4216
03:21:23,960 --> 03:21:27,920
These people that are conscientious and responsible.

4217
03:21:27,920 --> 03:21:31,640
I think they'll quickly understand Bitcoin's

4218
03:21:31,640 --> 03:21:35,440
value proposition and help elucidate it to the world.

4219
03:21:35,440 --> 03:21:38,160
I'm trying to remember what he said about it.

4220
03:21:38,160 --> 03:21:41,160
Basically, I think his support of Bitcoin

4221
03:21:41,160 --> 03:21:45,720
is grounded in the kind of people who are opposing Bitcoin.

4222
03:21:46,960 --> 03:21:49,600
So without understanding Bitcoin,

4223
03:21:49,600 --> 03:21:51,240
he starts to like Bitcoin

4224
03:21:51,240 --> 03:21:53,280
because of the people who are opposing it.

4225
03:21:53,280 --> 03:21:56,080
He's not a big fan of Bitcoin.

4226
03:21:56,080 --> 03:22:01,080
I mean, that's partially why I am interested in Bitcoin.

4227
03:22:03,680 --> 03:22:08,560
It's like all the people in power

4228
03:22:08,560 --> 03:22:13,560
and all the kind of shady, fraudulent, non-genuine people

4229
03:22:14,240 --> 03:22:19,240
who are dismissing Bitcoin are making me think, hmm.

4230
03:22:19,240 --> 03:22:23,520
One of Jordan's definitions of God is,

4231
03:22:23,520 --> 03:22:26,760
he says, God is found in the truthful speech

4232
03:22:26,760 --> 03:22:29,160
that rectifies pathological hierarchies.

4233
03:22:30,320 --> 03:22:34,680
And I think that is a beautiful definition

4234
03:22:34,680 --> 03:22:36,680
of what Bitcoin is doing in the world.

4235
03:22:36,680 --> 03:22:39,080
And that we have this pathological hierarchy

4236
03:22:39,080 --> 03:22:40,840
called central banking,

4237
03:22:40,840 --> 03:22:43,600
by which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer,

4238
03:22:45,040 --> 03:22:48,280
that is used as a mechanism for perpetual theft

4239
03:22:48,280 --> 03:22:51,320
and funding warfare at a global scale.

4240
03:22:51,320 --> 03:22:53,640
Like Ron Paul said, it's no coincidence

4241
03:22:53,640 --> 03:22:56,080
that the 20th century of total war

4242
03:22:56,080 --> 03:22:58,080
was also the century of central banking.

4243
03:22:59,560 --> 03:23:04,560
When you have an institution of currency counterfeiting,

4244
03:23:04,600 --> 03:23:06,680
which the central bank is,

4245
03:23:06,680 --> 03:23:09,360
you are no longer bounded by your own balance sheet

4246
03:23:09,360 --> 03:23:10,320
when you go to war.

4247
03:23:10,320 --> 03:23:12,360
You don't have to just go to war on your own resources.

4248
03:23:12,360 --> 03:23:15,200
You can now pillage the commonwealth

4249
03:23:15,200 --> 03:23:18,960
and pull for the savings of society as a whole

4250
03:23:18,960 --> 03:23:20,480
before you go bankrupt.

4251
03:23:20,480 --> 03:23:22,920
And indeed, this is what Hitler did, right?

4252
03:23:22,920 --> 03:23:27,360
Hitler hyperinflated in the Weimar Republic

4253
03:23:27,360 --> 03:23:29,440
to fund his war efforts.

4254
03:23:30,880 --> 03:23:34,720
And frankly, every dictator, every world war,

4255
03:23:34,720 --> 03:23:37,600
every internment camp in history

4256
03:23:37,600 --> 03:23:41,040
was made possible by the weaponization of money

4257
03:23:41,040 --> 03:23:42,520
in fiat currency.

4258
03:23:42,520 --> 03:23:45,920
So I hope, I know Jordan Peterson

4259
03:23:45,920 --> 03:23:48,440
is a huge proponent of free speech.

4260
03:23:48,440 --> 03:23:51,760
And I think that's ultimately at its deepest essence

4261
03:23:51,760 --> 03:23:53,160
that's what Bitcoin really is, right?

4262
03:23:53,160 --> 03:23:56,800
It is just the purest form of monetary speech

4263
03:23:56,800 --> 03:23:58,520
we've ever had.

4264
03:23:58,520 --> 03:24:02,920
And by purifying that primary operating system

4265
03:24:02,920 --> 03:24:03,800
of human action,

4266
03:24:03,800 --> 03:24:07,880
I think we can eliminate this pathological hierarchy

4267
03:24:07,880 --> 03:24:10,240
that is unfortunately the dominant institution

4268
03:24:10,240 --> 03:24:11,760
in the world today.

4269
03:24:11,760 --> 03:24:13,360
Yeah, I'm definitely,

4270
03:24:13,360 --> 03:24:16,320
especially with these explorations of Bitcoin,

4271
03:24:16,320 --> 03:24:18,040
this journey I've been on,

4272
03:24:18,040 --> 03:24:21,360
I'll revisit some of the aspects of human history

4273
03:24:21,360 --> 03:24:22,520
that I've been looking at,

4274
03:24:22,520 --> 03:24:26,440
like Stalin and Hitler from a perspective

4275
03:24:26,440 --> 03:24:28,840
of a monetary perspective.

4276
03:24:28,840 --> 03:24:33,120
Like what are the effects of inflation?

4277
03:24:33,120 --> 03:24:38,000
How was it used as a tool in gaining power

4278
03:24:38,000 --> 03:24:43,000
and maintaining power and manipulating the populace

4279
03:24:43,040 --> 03:24:47,880
in doing, in inflicting suffering

4280
03:24:47,880 --> 03:24:51,440
and I would say evil onto the world.

4281
03:24:51,440 --> 03:24:52,360
It's interesting.

4282
03:24:53,680 --> 03:24:54,760
It's interesting.

4283
03:24:54,760 --> 03:24:56,920
I'm gonna have to sort of go back into the hole.

4284
03:24:56,920 --> 03:25:01,760
So I tend to focus more on the human nature

4285
03:25:02,840 --> 03:25:07,400
and less about the tools that human nature leverages

4286
03:25:07,400 --> 03:25:08,880
to effect change.

4287
03:25:08,880 --> 03:25:11,160
But you're right that in some sense,

4288
03:25:11,160 --> 03:25:16,160
money is a tool which can be effectively used

4289
03:25:16,160 --> 03:25:21,160
to perform moral and immoral actions

4290
03:25:21,840 --> 03:25:23,600
depending on how it's used.

4291
03:25:23,600 --> 03:25:25,800
There's a feedback between the two, right?

4292
03:25:25,800 --> 03:25:30,800
There's specifically with money itself,

4293
03:25:31,800 --> 03:25:36,800
it's the, here's the way I've been posing it lately

4294
03:25:39,640 --> 03:25:41,400
is that I actually think,

4295
03:25:41,400 --> 03:25:43,600
we typically think of people as good or bad

4296
03:25:43,600 --> 03:25:45,880
or again, trying to label people all the time.

4297
03:25:45,880 --> 03:25:48,160
But I think people and their characters

4298
03:25:48,160 --> 03:25:51,080
are emergent properties of the incentive structures

4299
03:25:51,080 --> 03:25:52,000
they inhabit.

4300
03:25:52,000 --> 03:25:52,840
Yeah.

4301
03:25:52,840 --> 03:25:55,680
So what does Charlie Munger say?

4302
03:25:55,680 --> 03:25:56,960
Don't show me the incentives,

4303
03:25:56,960 --> 03:25:59,520
I'll show you the outcome kind of thing.

4304
03:25:59,520 --> 03:26:01,840
This is a flawed incentive structure

4305
03:26:01,840 --> 03:26:03,600
we've been operating within.

4306
03:26:03,600 --> 03:26:05,800
Now I'm not speaking to the intention,

4307
03:26:05,800 --> 03:26:07,160
people wanna argue with me all the time.

4308
03:26:07,160 --> 03:26:09,680
Like Jerome Powell's not a bad guy.

4309
03:26:09,680 --> 03:26:11,240
He's doing his best at the central bank.

4310
03:26:11,240 --> 03:26:12,600
He's doing what he thinks is right.

4311
03:26:12,600 --> 03:26:13,440
That's fine.

4312
03:26:14,600 --> 03:26:15,440
Well, that's true or not,

4313
03:26:15,440 --> 03:26:16,320
it actually doesn't matter.

4314
03:26:16,320 --> 03:26:19,000
The intention is divergent from the outcome.

4315
03:26:19,000 --> 03:26:20,600
The institution that they are running

4316
03:26:20,600 --> 03:26:22,960
is premised on deception and theft

4317
03:26:22,960 --> 03:26:25,600
and it is handicapping the productive economy.

4318
03:26:25,600 --> 03:26:28,960
So when we're, even the terms we use, printing money,

4319
03:26:28,960 --> 03:26:30,520
you're not creating any new value.

4320
03:26:30,520 --> 03:26:32,440
You're not infusing the economy with anything,

4321
03:26:32,440 --> 03:26:34,480
any new productive factors whatsoever.

4322
03:26:34,480 --> 03:26:36,760
You're just harvesting the economic surplus

4323
03:26:36,760 --> 03:26:39,640
created by entrepreneurs in the marketplace.

4324
03:26:39,640 --> 03:26:42,520
It's impossible to add any value to an economy

4325
03:26:42,520 --> 03:26:45,720
by increasing the paper claims on its savings.

4326
03:26:45,720 --> 03:26:50,720
So there's a feedback loop between man and tool,

4327
03:26:51,680 --> 03:26:53,320
between creator and created.

4328
03:26:53,320 --> 03:26:57,000
And I think we have to honor the relationship

4329
03:26:57,000 --> 03:26:58,600
above either one, right?

4330
03:26:58,600 --> 03:27:00,560
Trying to put the right people in the system

4331
03:27:00,560 --> 03:27:01,760
or just build the right system.

4332
03:27:01,760 --> 03:27:03,320
We need both.

4333
03:27:03,320 --> 03:27:05,200
Do you think the interesting question

4334
03:27:05,200 --> 03:27:10,200
of whether the people that are in control of central banks

4335
03:27:10,200 --> 03:27:13,720
or in positions of power there,

4336
03:27:13,720 --> 03:27:16,280
if they themselves are malevolent,

4337
03:27:16,280 --> 03:27:18,880
if they themselves are bad actors,

4338
03:27:18,880 --> 03:27:23,880
or they're simply like leaves floating along the river,

4339
03:27:24,400 --> 03:27:29,400
sort of just the cog in the machine,

4340
03:27:29,840 --> 03:27:31,400
an ant in an ant colony

4341
03:27:31,400 --> 03:27:33,960
that operates in a certain kind of way.

4342
03:27:33,960 --> 03:27:36,720
Like where do you put the blame?

4343
03:27:36,720 --> 03:27:39,400
Do you put the blame on the way

4344
03:27:39,400 --> 03:27:42,680
things are operating onto the individuals

4345
03:27:42,680 --> 03:27:46,960
or onto the system itself, the idea behind the system?

4346
03:27:46,960 --> 03:27:50,840
Where, and is it useful to place the blame somewhere?

4347
03:27:50,840 --> 03:27:53,360
Because for me, it might be useful to understand that

4348
03:27:53,360 --> 03:27:57,080
in order to figure out what the solution is.

4349
03:27:57,080 --> 03:27:59,840
I tend to not put the blame on the individual.

4350
03:27:59,840 --> 03:28:02,320
Like I tend to believe most people are good

4351
03:28:02,320 --> 03:28:04,320
and want to see themselves as good.

4352
03:28:05,320 --> 03:28:07,760
And so in that case, it's very difficult

4353
03:28:07,760 --> 03:28:11,120
to be truly malevolent as you would need to be to control,

4354
03:28:11,120 --> 03:28:13,880
to gain centralized power at the large scale.

4355
03:28:14,840 --> 03:28:18,160
But I know a lot of conspiracy theorists

4356
03:28:19,120 --> 03:28:22,720
and just a lot of people think that there is evil

4357
03:28:22,720 --> 03:28:25,720
humans in the world that seek power,

4358
03:28:25,720 --> 03:28:27,680
maintain that power, and then use that power

4359
03:28:27,680 --> 03:28:28,880
for bad purposes.

4360
03:28:30,760 --> 03:28:32,360
I think they're just people.

4361
03:28:32,360 --> 03:28:34,440
And they're just trying to get something for nothing,

4362
03:28:34,440 --> 03:28:36,280
like all of us do.

4363
03:28:36,280 --> 03:28:38,800
I like this framework of thought that you have.

4364
03:28:38,800 --> 03:28:42,160
Honestly, and that's what the central bank is,

4365
03:28:42,160 --> 03:28:45,000
is the ultimate institution to get something for nothing.

4366
03:28:45,000 --> 03:28:49,720
You get a perpetual income stream,

4367
03:28:49,720 --> 03:28:52,480
the ability to acquire more and more territory

4368
03:28:52,480 --> 03:28:56,520
in the world through monopolizing the supply of money.

4369
03:28:57,440 --> 03:29:00,080
And you can literally print money.

4370
03:29:00,080 --> 03:29:02,080
You can buy your way out of anything

4371
03:29:02,080 --> 03:29:04,520
and buy your way into anything in the world.

4372
03:29:04,520 --> 03:29:06,960
So it is, I think the most,

4373
03:29:08,800 --> 03:29:11,560
not say the most, but a group of very intelligent people

4374
03:29:11,560 --> 03:29:13,480
put this thing together and figured out

4375
03:29:13,480 --> 03:29:15,720
how to get something for nothing in perpetuity

4376
03:29:18,560 --> 03:29:21,280
by clouding people's conception of money.

4377
03:29:21,280 --> 03:29:24,800
And if we look at the central bank,

4378
03:29:24,800 --> 03:29:25,720
it's been around for a while,

4379
03:29:25,720 --> 03:29:29,440
but the latest implementation here in the US is the Fed.

4380
03:29:29,440 --> 03:29:30,560
It's about a hundred years old.

4381
03:29:30,560 --> 03:29:32,200
It's an analog age institution

4382
03:29:32,200 --> 03:29:36,200
that I think has lost a lot of its relevance

4383
03:29:36,200 --> 03:29:37,960
in the modern age.

4384
03:29:37,960 --> 03:29:40,200
And I don't think it will survive

4385
03:29:40,200 --> 03:29:43,040
the ever-galvanizing gaze of the digital age.

4386
03:29:43,040 --> 03:29:44,600
There's just too much sunlight,

4387
03:29:45,680 --> 03:29:47,040
too much transparency today.

4388
03:29:47,040 --> 03:29:49,440
Ideas move too quickly for something like this

4389
03:29:49,440 --> 03:29:51,360
to remain relevant.

4390
03:29:51,360 --> 03:29:54,000
But they are just people.

4391
03:29:54,000 --> 03:29:55,800
They are just seeking something for nothing.

4392
03:29:55,800 --> 03:29:58,240
But I think when you concentrate that much power

4393
03:29:58,240 --> 03:29:59,480
and that much control,

4394
03:29:59,480 --> 03:30:02,360
that much wealth into the hands of few,

4395
03:30:02,360 --> 03:30:05,000
it does change.

4396
03:30:05,000 --> 03:30:07,800
Hayek argued that the nature of power,

4397
03:30:09,320 --> 03:30:11,600
again, it's something that we all sort of desire.

4398
03:30:11,600 --> 03:30:14,120
To be completely powerless, you're really unhappy, right?

4399
03:30:14,120 --> 03:30:16,360
If you're totally powerless, you're a slave.

4400
03:30:16,360 --> 03:30:17,720
Someone else tells you what to do.

4401
03:30:17,720 --> 03:30:19,000
You have no autonomy.

4402
03:30:19,000 --> 03:30:20,600
It's miserable, right?

4403
03:30:20,600 --> 03:30:21,880
So there's this,

4404
03:30:21,880 --> 03:30:24,600
it makes the consolidation of power alluring

4405
03:30:24,600 --> 03:30:25,920
in that we want to protect ourselves

4406
03:30:25,920 --> 03:30:28,400
from that slave state, let's say.

4407
03:30:28,400 --> 03:30:30,760
But like many things, it can be taken too far.

4408
03:30:31,720 --> 03:30:35,520
And when you concentrate power into too few hands,

4409
03:30:35,520 --> 03:30:38,520
Hayek argues that it actually transforms.

4410
03:30:38,520 --> 03:30:41,080
It becomes something much more intoxicating

4411
03:30:41,080 --> 03:30:44,200
than it would be if it was held in a more distributed way.

4412
03:30:44,200 --> 03:30:47,400
And I think that gets into a lot of these,

4413
03:30:48,680 --> 03:30:50,240
I don't know if they call themselves elites

4414
03:30:50,240 --> 03:30:51,760
or people call them elites or whatever,

4415
03:30:51,760 --> 03:30:54,960
like let's say shareholders of central banks,

4416
03:30:54,960 --> 03:30:56,800
people participating in the World Economic Forum,

4417
03:30:56,800 --> 03:31:01,720
things like this, they come, I guess the incentives, right?

4418
03:31:01,720 --> 03:31:05,440
The incentive schema they're in is rewarding them constantly,

4419
03:31:05,440 --> 03:31:06,720
telling them everything they're doing,

4420
03:31:06,720 --> 03:31:08,040
seeing and thinking is correct

4421
03:31:08,040 --> 03:31:10,920
because they just keep getting richer all the time.

4422
03:31:10,920 --> 03:31:15,160
And it leads you closer to this definition of evil,

4423
03:31:15,160 --> 03:31:19,920
which in the book, Paradise Lost, Friedman said,

4424
03:31:19,920 --> 03:31:22,120
"'Evil is the force which believes its knowledge

4425
03:31:22,120 --> 03:31:23,800
is complete.'"

4426
03:31:23,800 --> 03:31:27,440
So these people become more and more convinced

4427
03:31:27,440 --> 03:31:32,240
that they have the plan or they have the course of action

4428
03:31:32,240 --> 03:31:33,320
that will save the world,

4429
03:31:33,320 --> 03:31:35,680
that if everyone would just listen to them,

4430
03:31:35,680 --> 03:31:38,040
that they would lead us to the promised land, right?

4431
03:31:38,040 --> 03:31:41,200
Whether this is Bill Gates saving us from a climate crisis

4432
03:31:41,200 --> 03:31:44,600
or any of these other economic policies

4433
03:31:44,600 --> 03:31:46,440
that are targeted at a certain outcome,

4434
03:31:46,440 --> 03:31:50,080
but almost always diverge almost perfectly from that outcome,

4435
03:31:50,080 --> 03:31:51,480
creating its opposite effect.

4436
03:31:51,480 --> 03:31:56,480
I think that's the problem, that we have this mechanism

4437
03:31:56,920 --> 03:31:59,120
that can concentrate wealth and power

4438
03:31:59,120 --> 03:32:01,480
into the hands of so few,

4439
03:32:01,480 --> 03:32:04,440
that it leads to the proliferation of evil,

4440
03:32:05,680 --> 03:32:07,000
meaning that it convinces people

4441
03:32:07,000 --> 03:32:08,320
that their knowledge is complete.

4442
03:32:08,320 --> 03:32:12,800
Whereas something like a Bitcoin

4443
03:32:12,800 --> 03:32:14,680
almost forces the opposite outcome.

4444
03:32:14,680 --> 03:32:19,680
In a Bitcoin denominated world,

4445
03:32:19,800 --> 03:32:24,280
in a pure free market, the consumer is sovereign.

4446
03:32:24,280 --> 03:32:27,800
So you cannot earn value in the world

4447
03:32:27,800 --> 03:32:30,320
unless you are serving your fellow man,

4448
03:32:30,320 --> 03:32:33,880
unless they have expressed through their buy and sell

4449
03:32:33,880 --> 03:32:35,600
decisions in the marketplace, right?

4450
03:32:35,600 --> 03:32:39,360
You've created a satisfaction of a particular want

4451
03:32:39,360 --> 03:32:41,320
that they value so much,

4452
03:32:41,320 --> 03:32:42,960
they've acquired so much of your good or service

4453
03:32:42,960 --> 03:32:45,000
that you've become rich.

4454
03:32:45,000 --> 03:32:47,000
You can only maintain that position of wealth

4455
03:32:47,000 --> 03:32:49,800
so long as you continue to serve your fellow man.

4456
03:32:49,800 --> 03:32:54,040
So it changes the incentives such that dominance

4457
03:32:54,040 --> 03:32:56,760
in the world is no longer,

4458
03:32:56,760 --> 03:32:58,920
can no longer be paired with coercion.

4459
03:32:58,920 --> 03:33:01,480
It has to be paired with competence.

4460
03:33:01,480 --> 03:33:05,280
And that's how this, when we say Bitcoin fixes this,

4461
03:33:05,280 --> 03:33:06,120
that's what we mean.

4462
03:33:06,120 --> 03:33:09,120
Like it restores that skin in the game,

4463
03:33:09,120 --> 03:33:11,200
that balance of incentives and disincentives

4464
03:33:11,200 --> 03:33:13,760
that help us properly navigate reality.

4465
03:33:13,760 --> 03:33:17,120
And it prevents the buildup of systemic rot

4466
03:33:17,120 --> 03:33:18,960
like we see with the central bank.

4467
03:33:20,080 --> 03:33:22,960
What books, people love this question

4468
03:33:22,960 --> 03:33:25,680
and you're exceptionally well-read,

4469
03:33:25,680 --> 03:33:28,040
you've explored all kinds of ideas.

4470
03:33:28,040 --> 03:33:30,320
Is there some books, technical fiction,

4471
03:33:30,320 --> 03:33:34,240
philosophical, coloring books, children's books

4472
03:33:34,240 --> 03:33:37,960
had an impact on your life and you would maybe recommend

4473
03:33:37,960 --> 03:33:39,560
to others that they should read?

4474
03:33:39,560 --> 03:33:43,200
I think we mentioned a couple of them here today,

4475
03:33:43,200 --> 03:33:47,800
but I think a really useful triplet of books

4476
03:33:49,200 --> 03:33:50,800
that I've been recommending recently

4477
03:33:50,800 --> 03:33:55,800
to help diffuse this materialist worldview of reality

4478
03:33:56,120 --> 03:33:58,960
where we still think in kind of the Newtonian model

4479
03:33:58,960 --> 03:34:01,240
that it's atoms and cause and effect.

4480
03:34:03,480 --> 03:34:05,200
I'd first recommend Jordan Peterson's book,

4481
03:34:05,200 --> 03:34:06,200
Maps of Meaning.

4482
03:34:06,200 --> 03:34:11,200
And it's a deep dive into mythology

4483
03:34:11,280 --> 03:34:14,120
and how it's developed over the course of history

4484
03:34:14,120 --> 03:34:17,280
and how it's reflected both in our social structures

4485
03:34:17,280 --> 03:34:21,360
and our intra-psychic nature really,

4486
03:34:21,360 --> 03:34:23,320
and how they come to reflect one another in a way,

4487
03:34:23,320 --> 03:34:25,800
like the way we think again shapes the world

4488
03:34:25,800 --> 03:34:26,960
and then the way the world is shaped,

4489
03:34:26,960 --> 03:34:28,160
shapes the way we think.

4490
03:34:29,800 --> 03:34:30,800
That's an excellent book.

4491
03:34:30,800 --> 03:34:33,520
It's very dense and difficult read.

4492
03:34:33,520 --> 03:34:35,360
Actually this trilogy is pretty brutal,

4493
03:34:35,360 --> 03:34:38,560
it'll probably take you a year to read, hours a day.

4494
03:34:39,480 --> 03:34:40,680
The second one I mentioned earlier

4495
03:34:40,680 --> 03:34:42,440
was Human Action by Mises.

4496
03:34:44,360 --> 03:34:46,600
The ultimate tome on Austrian economics

4497
03:34:46,600 --> 03:34:50,280
will help explicate this realm of relevance,

4498
03:34:50,280 --> 03:34:52,200
I think that economics truly is,

4499
03:34:52,200 --> 03:34:57,040
where again, there are things

4500
03:34:57,040 --> 03:35:00,120
and then these things become means or ends

4501
03:35:00,120 --> 03:35:03,240
once we channel our purpose through them.

4502
03:35:03,240 --> 03:35:07,560
So this realm of non-materialist relevance

4503
03:35:07,560 --> 03:35:10,520
that I think is really important to grasping economics

4504
03:35:10,520 --> 03:35:11,760
at a first principles level,

4505
03:35:11,760 --> 03:35:14,080
I think that book lays it out tremendously.

4506
03:35:15,440 --> 03:35:16,520
And then the last one would be,

4507
03:35:16,520 --> 03:35:17,600
I think I mentioned this at the beginning,

4508
03:35:17,600 --> 03:35:19,960
was that book Lila by Robert Persig,

4509
03:35:19,960 --> 03:35:23,840
where he's making the case that value is fundamental.

4510
03:35:23,840 --> 03:35:25,680
And all of these books,

4511
03:35:25,680 --> 03:35:27,600
they kinda all point to that actually.

4512
03:35:27,600 --> 03:35:31,120
They're pointing back to value being the fundamental thing,

4513
03:35:31,120 --> 03:35:35,360
values expressed through moral action

4514
03:35:35,360 --> 03:35:37,960
as being the fundamental substrate of reality.

4515
03:35:37,960 --> 03:35:42,080
So if you're like me, I grew up quite scientific minded,

4516
03:35:42,080 --> 03:35:43,360
it'll help diffuse some of that

4517
03:35:43,360 --> 03:35:45,960
and maybe retrain you to the other side of reality.

4518
03:35:47,560 --> 03:35:49,240
So you said these books are difficult,

4519
03:35:49,240 --> 03:35:52,840
maybe you can comment on which aspect is difficult.

4520
03:35:52,840 --> 03:35:55,360
Is it just the technical nature, is it the length,

4521
03:35:55,360 --> 03:35:56,920
is it the depth of the ideas

4522
03:35:56,920 --> 03:35:58,920
or how long it takes to integrate them?

4523
03:35:58,920 --> 03:36:01,760
And more sort of importantly,

4524
03:36:01,760 --> 03:36:04,240
is there recommendation advice you can give

4525
03:36:04,240 --> 03:36:09,240
on how to integrate these ideas,

4526
03:36:09,520 --> 03:36:13,880
how to read, how to learn in the spaces there

4527
03:36:13,880 --> 03:36:15,240
from your own life?

4528
03:36:15,240 --> 03:36:17,040
Like how do you enjoy taking an ideas?

4529
03:36:17,040 --> 03:36:18,200
And this could be for these books,

4530
03:36:18,200 --> 03:36:21,160
but also in the Bitcoin world

4531
03:36:21,160 --> 03:36:24,560
and reading a bunch of different ideas written by others,

4532
03:36:24,560 --> 03:36:28,240
just integrating stuff, even watching podcasts

4533
03:36:28,240 --> 03:36:29,720
and all those kinds of things.

4534
03:36:29,720 --> 03:36:32,520
Yeah, I'm a reader, I love to read.

4535
03:36:33,760 --> 03:36:36,000
One of the most useful things I've ever done

4536
03:36:36,000 --> 03:36:37,720
was take a speed reading course.

4537
03:36:38,960 --> 03:36:40,160
I actually think there's a version of this

4538
03:36:40,160 --> 03:36:41,680
available on Tim Ferriss's website.

4539
03:36:41,680 --> 03:36:44,320
It's like a 30 minute speed reading course.

4540
03:36:44,320 --> 03:36:45,760
It's all about eye movement.

4541
03:36:45,760 --> 03:36:48,600
Instead of moving your eye continuously line over line,

4542
03:36:48,600 --> 03:36:50,600
it's more about jumping in your brain.

4543
03:36:50,600 --> 03:36:53,600
You can train your brain to just absorb words

4544
03:36:53,600 --> 03:36:56,960
in their totality versus kind of reading word by word.

4545
03:36:56,960 --> 03:37:00,800
And also not, I haven't fully taken that journey actually,

4546
03:37:00,800 --> 03:37:05,440
but I remember taking a few steps on that journey,

4547
03:37:05,440 --> 03:37:08,680
realizing that I'm speaking inside my head.

4548
03:37:08,680 --> 03:37:09,520
Yeah.

4549
03:37:09,520 --> 03:37:10,880
I'm saying the words inside my head

4550
03:37:10,880 --> 03:37:12,240
and that's actually getting in the way.

4551
03:37:12,240 --> 03:37:13,080
That's right.

4552
03:37:13,080 --> 03:37:15,120
So there's a lot of little hacks like that.

4553
03:37:15,120 --> 03:37:17,120
I maybe lazily, I'll have to,

4554
03:37:17,120 --> 03:37:19,360
now that you mentioned I'll have to revisit this,

4555
03:37:19,360 --> 03:37:23,720
but I have convinced myself that I don't need to read faster

4556
03:37:23,720 --> 03:37:25,480
because that's not ultimately the bottleneck.

4557
03:37:25,480 --> 03:37:28,400
The bottleneck is in the me thinking about stuff.

4558
03:37:28,400 --> 03:37:30,480
In fact, I like reading really slowly

4559
03:37:30,480 --> 03:37:31,960
or so I convinced myself.

4560
03:37:32,840 --> 03:37:35,560
Because ultimately it's not about gaining more information.

4561
03:37:35,560 --> 03:37:39,280
It's about time spent thinking deeply.

4562
03:37:39,280 --> 03:37:40,320
Yes.

4563
03:37:40,320 --> 03:37:43,320
But maybe that's just me being very lazy

4564
03:37:43,320 --> 03:37:44,240
because yes, it's true.

4565
03:37:44,240 --> 03:37:45,480
It's important to think deeply,

4566
03:37:45,480 --> 03:37:49,400
but maybe I could speed up the consumption of information.

4567
03:37:49,400 --> 03:37:50,480
It's fine.

4568
03:37:50,480 --> 03:37:51,920
I like to be dynamic actually.

4569
03:37:51,920 --> 03:37:55,360
So usually speed reading initially

4570
03:37:55,360 --> 03:37:58,440
and that diffused that internal dialogue for me

4571
03:37:58,440 --> 03:37:59,760
because when I was reading one word at a time,

4572
03:37:59,760 --> 03:38:00,600
I was having that too.

4573
03:38:00,600 --> 03:38:02,120
You almost get a feedback in your own head

4574
03:38:02,120 --> 03:38:03,280
when you're reading the word out loud

4575
03:38:03,280 --> 03:38:04,680
and it's clouding your thoughts.

4576
03:38:04,680 --> 03:38:06,600
And if you're speed reading, you can't do that.

4577
03:38:06,600 --> 03:38:08,680
You're taking in groups of words at a time

4578
03:38:08,680 --> 03:38:13,120
so you can't internally verbalize it, I guess.

4579
03:38:13,120 --> 03:38:15,600
And then I also am really big on annotating,

4580
03:38:15,600 --> 03:38:17,760
underlining, writing in the margins.

4581
03:38:17,760 --> 03:38:20,040
I prefer a physical book,

4582
03:38:20,040 --> 03:38:21,440
but I also read the Kindle a lot

4583
03:38:21,440 --> 03:38:23,160
because it's just so convenient.

4584
03:38:23,160 --> 03:38:25,480
Anywhere you're waiting in line or every night before bed,

4585
03:38:25,480 --> 03:38:27,120
I'm reading my Kindle.

4586
03:38:27,120 --> 03:38:30,160
And I also advocate rereading a lot.

4587
03:38:30,160 --> 03:38:34,640
So if you found something that struck you at a deep level,

4588
03:38:34,640 --> 03:38:36,120
you found particularly fascinating,

4589
03:38:36,120 --> 03:38:37,560
like you have to listen to that.

4590
03:38:37,560 --> 03:38:41,400
That's your, I don't know, your mind or your spirit signal

4591
03:38:41,400 --> 03:38:43,560
that that is something meaningful to you.

4592
03:38:43,560 --> 03:38:46,400
And you should, to your point, reread it,

4593
03:38:46,400 --> 03:38:49,240
sit with it for a long time, write about it.

4594
03:38:49,240 --> 03:38:53,400
And that becomes the ultimate triumvirate

4595
03:38:53,400 --> 03:38:55,240
of synthesizing an idea, actually.

4596
03:38:55,240 --> 03:38:58,720
If you can read about it and then write about it

4597
03:38:59,680 --> 03:39:01,200
and then go and talk about it,

4598
03:39:01,200 --> 03:39:03,280
you get this crystallization of understanding

4599
03:39:03,280 --> 03:39:05,720
that's just not possible doing any one of the three

4600
03:39:05,720 --> 03:39:06,920
or any two of the three.

4601
03:39:08,320 --> 03:39:12,680
So I definitely highly recommend people to do that.

4602
03:39:12,680 --> 03:39:16,480
And in terms of how are those books difficult?

4603
03:39:16,480 --> 03:39:17,800
I mean, in any case,

4604
03:39:17,800 --> 03:39:19,880
are those books difficult, I mean, in every way,

4605
03:39:19,880 --> 03:39:21,440
they're all long books.

4606
03:39:22,720 --> 03:39:26,800
In terms of density, I would say Lila is the less,

4607
03:39:26,800 --> 03:39:30,760
the least dense, maybe Maps of Meaning.

4608
03:39:32,320 --> 03:39:33,480
I don't know, but Maps of Meaning

4609
03:39:33,480 --> 03:39:35,960
and Human Action are both extremely dense.

4610
03:39:35,960 --> 03:39:40,360
But they're just, I had to read those books very slow.

4611
03:39:40,360 --> 03:39:42,800
You just have to take your time with them.

4612
03:39:42,800 --> 03:39:44,240
To give you an idea with Jordan Peterson,

4613
03:39:44,240 --> 03:39:47,160
he's said this a lot with Maps of Meaning.

4614
03:39:47,160 --> 03:39:50,480
He spent three hours a day writing for 15 years

4615
03:39:50,480 --> 03:39:51,400
to write that book.

4616
03:39:51,400 --> 03:39:53,920
It's probably, I think it's a 600-page book.

4617
03:39:53,920 --> 03:39:55,960
He said he estimates he rewrote every sentence

4618
03:39:55,960 --> 03:39:59,160
in the book 50 times, five, zero,

4619
03:39:59,160 --> 03:40:02,080
to try and get it just perfected.

4620
03:40:02,080 --> 03:40:04,320
And when you read these sentences,

4621
03:40:05,240 --> 03:40:07,800
you can tell that he rewrote it 50 times.

4622
03:40:08,880 --> 03:40:12,760
I've used actually Anki for space repetition.

4623
03:40:14,000 --> 03:40:15,800
It's like a piece of, it's an app.

4624
03:40:15,800 --> 03:40:17,280
I'm not sure if you're familiar with it,

4625
03:40:17,280 --> 03:40:22,280
but it allows you to load in facts or terms

4626
03:40:22,280 --> 03:40:24,440
or entire paragraphs.

4627
03:40:24,440 --> 03:40:29,440
And then it brings them, you review them every day,

4628
03:40:29,840 --> 03:40:33,800
and then it brings them up less and less often over time

4629
03:40:33,800 --> 03:40:36,400
as you show yourself being able to remember

4630
03:40:36,400 --> 03:40:39,680
the thing that you wanted to memorize.

4631
03:40:39,680 --> 03:40:41,560
And oftentimes when I'm reading,

4632
03:40:41,560 --> 03:40:44,160
what I want to memorize is the key idea.

4633
03:40:44,160 --> 03:40:47,160
But also I use it for, I'm terrible with names,

4634
03:40:47,160 --> 03:40:49,200
so I started to use it for names too,

4635
03:40:49,200 --> 03:40:53,560
names of people, names of people that I want to remember.

4636
03:40:53,560 --> 03:40:56,560
And also throughout history and also in my personal life,

4637
03:40:56,560 --> 03:40:58,160
but also events.

4638
03:40:58,160 --> 03:41:00,200
Dates to me are usually not important,

4639
03:41:00,200 --> 03:41:03,040
but sometimes dates are really important.

4640
03:41:03,040 --> 03:41:04,400
And so it's really useful.

4641
03:41:04,400 --> 03:41:05,320
I recommend it highly.

4642
03:41:05,320 --> 03:41:08,680
Naval, I think, mentioned a piece of software

4643
03:41:08,680 --> 03:41:11,560
called Readwise or something like that,

4644
03:41:11,560 --> 03:41:14,680
that I hope I'm saying that correctly.

4645
03:41:14,680 --> 03:41:16,320
It's something like that.

4646
03:41:16,320 --> 03:41:18,960
And what it does is it goes to your highlights

4647
03:41:18,960 --> 03:41:23,040
from your Kindle or the various places

4648
03:41:23,040 --> 03:41:27,800
where you highlight stuff that integrates with Goodreads.

4649
03:41:27,800 --> 03:41:30,000
And it does the same kind of spaced repetition,

4650
03:41:30,000 --> 03:41:31,680
but for things you've highlighted.

4651
03:41:31,680 --> 03:41:34,800
So it sends an email every day.

4652
03:41:36,000 --> 03:41:38,400
It's been really, I recommend it highly

4653
03:41:38,400 --> 03:41:43,400
because it sends, to me, an email form,

4654
03:41:43,480 --> 03:41:45,400
a selection of the things I've highlighted

4655
03:41:45,400 --> 03:41:47,160
and previous things I've read.

4656
03:41:47,160 --> 03:41:52,160
And it's like this weird shock to your memory

4657
03:41:52,400 --> 03:41:57,400
that sprinkles, I have probably way too much Orwell in there.

4658
03:41:57,560 --> 03:42:00,280
And it just kind of like, it brings you back.

4659
03:42:00,280 --> 03:42:03,280
And these ideas are, because what you realize,

4660
03:42:03,280 --> 03:42:07,320
depending on how you highlight, but at least for me,

4661
03:42:07,320 --> 03:42:08,960
and I think it's probably true for a lot of people,

4662
03:42:08,960 --> 03:42:11,640
the things you've highlighted had, at that moment,

4663
03:42:11,640 --> 03:42:13,920
an emotional impact on you.

4664
03:42:13,920 --> 03:42:17,160
And so these things are just hitting you hard again.

4665
03:42:17,160 --> 03:42:19,600
It's like, whoa, it might not be meaningful

4666
03:42:19,600 --> 03:42:20,800
to anyone else except you.

4667
03:42:20,800 --> 03:42:23,320
And it's something I recommend.

4668
03:42:23,320 --> 03:42:26,120
You never know with these hacks or tools and so on

4669
03:42:26,120 --> 03:42:29,520
what's actually BS and what is amazing.

4670
03:42:29,520 --> 03:42:31,440
And that one is kind of amazing.

4671
03:42:31,440 --> 03:42:34,680
So at least for me, it works for me and Naval.

4672
03:42:34,680 --> 03:42:35,800
I think he's the one that-

4673
03:42:35,800 --> 03:42:37,960
Read wise, you said. Read wise.

4674
03:42:37,960 --> 03:42:39,960
Or something close to that.

4675
03:42:39,960 --> 03:42:41,480
It could be read something else,

4676
03:42:41,480 --> 03:42:43,680
like read wealth or something.

4677
03:42:43,680 --> 03:42:46,840
The one other thing I really like,

4678
03:42:46,840 --> 03:42:48,080
and this is more of a new one,

4679
03:42:48,080 --> 03:42:50,920
is I used to always listen to music at the gym,

4680
03:42:50,920 --> 03:42:54,600
but now I've just, because I'm so backlogged on podcasts,

4681
03:42:54,600 --> 03:42:59,160
there's so many, I exclusively listen to podcasts

4682
03:42:59,160 --> 03:43:00,440
when I'm walking or when I'm at the gym,

4683
03:43:00,440 --> 03:43:03,840
anytime I'm doing something that I can't read basically.

4684
03:43:03,840 --> 03:43:07,040
And I think there's something really special

4685
03:43:07,040 --> 03:43:09,360
about exercise and ideation.

4686
03:43:09,360 --> 03:43:12,400
I mean, I don't know if this happens to everyone,

4687
03:43:12,400 --> 03:43:14,520
but my creative juices just go ballistic.

4688
03:43:14,520 --> 03:43:17,560
When I'm at the gym, I hit a certain point of,

4689
03:43:17,560 --> 03:43:19,520
I guess, heart rate and you're sweating enough,

4690
03:43:19,520 --> 03:43:21,800
then the ideas just start to flow.

4691
03:43:21,800 --> 03:43:25,480
So I'm basically at the gym now listening to podcasts,

4692
03:43:25,480 --> 03:43:29,000
exercising as fast as I can to try to get to that state of,

4693
03:43:31,160 --> 03:43:33,480
where you're just straining, you're strenuous exercise,

4694
03:43:33,480 --> 03:43:34,360
I guess you would say.

4695
03:43:34,360 --> 03:43:36,360
And then I'm end up typing notes into my phone

4696
03:43:36,360 --> 03:43:39,200
as fast as I can with all these ideas that are flowing.

4697
03:43:39,200 --> 03:43:42,560
So I've created a lot of good writing out of that.

4698
03:43:42,560 --> 03:43:43,600
Yeah, it's kind of work.

4699
03:43:43,600 --> 03:43:47,920
So I do running quite a bit, so running outside,

4700
03:43:47,920 --> 03:43:52,440
and I'll listen to, okay, I told myself

4701
03:43:52,440 --> 03:43:55,040
this has been going on for about a year,

4702
03:43:55,040 --> 03:44:00,040
is I only listen to stuff that's either World War II

4703
03:44:00,800 --> 03:44:01,880
or World War I related.

4704
03:44:01,880 --> 03:44:06,880
So Hitler, Stalin, like difficult historical stuff.

4705
03:44:09,840 --> 03:44:13,200
And also listen to brown noise.

4706
03:44:13,200 --> 03:44:14,520
So those are the two modes.

4707
03:44:14,520 --> 03:44:18,480
So brown noise helps me, it's like white noise,

4708
03:44:18,480 --> 03:44:20,120
but like deeper, I guess.

4709
03:44:20,120 --> 03:44:22,600
It helps me remove the world.

4710
03:44:22,600 --> 03:44:24,880
And at the gym, there's a lot of distractions.

4711
03:44:24,880 --> 03:44:26,640
When you're running, there's a lot of distractions.

4712
03:44:26,640 --> 03:44:27,720
It helps me remove the world.

4713
03:44:27,720 --> 03:44:32,440
So one, I'll be listening to difficult historical ideas.

4714
03:44:32,440 --> 03:44:34,280
And then when my mind is all of a sudden

4715
03:44:34,280 --> 03:44:36,520
starting to generate ideas,

4716
03:44:36,520 --> 03:44:40,120
I'll listen to brown noise and then force myself to think.

4717
03:44:40,120 --> 03:44:44,440
It's kind of, it's meditative in a sense,

4718
03:44:44,440 --> 03:44:46,480
and your mind wants to be lazy.

4719
03:44:46,480 --> 03:44:51,480
You want to, it's hard, man, like running and thinking

4720
03:44:51,640 --> 03:44:53,760
in the sense that some of the ideas

4721
03:44:53,760 --> 03:44:56,280
that come into your head are pretty heavy.

4722
03:44:56,280 --> 03:44:57,440
It's about your own life.

4723
03:44:57,440 --> 03:44:59,600
It's your own demons come in there,

4724
03:44:59,600 --> 03:45:01,640
but also just difficult ideas

4725
03:45:01,640 --> 03:45:02,960
that require you thinking through

4726
03:45:02,960 --> 03:45:05,480
and persevering through that,

4727
03:45:05,480 --> 03:45:07,160
like not letting yourself get lazy

4728
03:45:07,160 --> 03:45:10,520
and thinking through it has been really for me rewarding

4729
03:45:10,520 --> 03:45:13,960
in the same way that you're saying it is for you.

4730
03:45:13,960 --> 03:45:16,840
It's true that like podcasts and music,

4731
03:45:16,840 --> 03:45:20,960
like shallow, like funny podcasts or music

4732
03:45:20,960 --> 03:45:23,400
have been a kind of filler distraction.

4733
03:45:24,520 --> 03:45:26,440
But informational podcasts,

4734
03:45:26,440 --> 03:45:31,000
like podcasts that have some depths of ideas or audio books

4735
03:45:31,000 --> 03:45:32,680
have been truly rewarding.

4736
03:45:32,680 --> 03:45:35,000
I try to listen now less and less to podcasts

4737
03:45:35,000 --> 03:45:35,960
that are just fun,

4738
03:45:37,840 --> 03:45:39,680
because I feel like I enjoy it too much

4739
03:45:39,680 --> 03:45:41,920
and I don't allow my mind to get bored

4740
03:45:41,920 --> 03:45:45,040
and to think through stuff, to explore ideas.

4741
03:45:45,040 --> 03:45:48,240
It's so easy to fill the space

4742
03:45:49,320 --> 03:45:52,760
that usually would be filled with thought

4743
03:45:52,760 --> 03:45:55,760
and instead fill it with fun podcasts.

4744
03:45:55,760 --> 03:45:58,360
Like there's a bunch of comedy podcasts I really enjoy.

4745
03:45:58,360 --> 03:46:00,360
So there's value to that, of course,

4746
03:46:00,360 --> 03:46:02,360
but you have to realize it's entertainment.

4747
03:46:05,280 --> 03:46:07,400
You don't get much value except entertainment.

4748
03:46:07,400 --> 03:46:08,240
Right, right.

4749
03:46:08,240 --> 03:46:11,000
And there's utility to the boredom too, I think,

4750
03:46:12,440 --> 03:46:15,480
to give your mind the space,

4751
03:46:15,480 --> 03:46:17,360
I guess your subconscious maybe the space

4752
03:46:17,360 --> 03:46:19,200
to chew on some of these problems, right?

4753
03:46:19,200 --> 03:46:22,080
Where you've imbibed so much knowledge,

4754
03:46:22,080 --> 03:46:23,480
you've highlighted and thought about something,

4755
03:46:23,480 --> 03:46:25,760
but then you need to stop thinking about it for a while

4756
03:46:25,760 --> 03:46:27,960
and let it marinate in the subconscious.

4757
03:46:27,960 --> 03:46:30,920
And then these flashes of insight

4758
03:46:30,920 --> 03:46:32,120
that people have described,

4759
03:46:32,120 --> 03:46:33,480
sometimes I get them in the middle of the night,

4760
03:46:33,480 --> 03:46:35,080
like I just wake up from a dream and have them

4761
03:46:35,080 --> 03:46:35,920
and I got to write it down

4762
03:46:35,920 --> 03:46:38,800
or sometimes just in nature taking a walk.

4763
03:46:38,800 --> 03:46:40,480
But I think that's very important too.

4764
03:46:40,480 --> 03:46:43,920
We can't just brute force our way into understanding.

4765
03:46:43,920 --> 03:46:45,560
You know, there's this interplay

4766
03:46:45,560 --> 03:46:47,720
between kind of the brute force reading intake

4767
03:46:47,720 --> 03:46:51,240
and then just relaxing, meditating, sleeping, being bored,

4768
03:46:51,240 --> 03:46:56,160
letting your subconscious do the heavy lifting.

4769
03:46:56,160 --> 03:46:59,240
And there's, I think you should be aware of the fact

4770
03:46:59,240 --> 03:47:01,160
that there's a war for your attention going on.

4771
03:47:01,160 --> 03:47:02,760
So there's a lot of,

4772
03:47:02,760 --> 03:47:05,560
there's been better and better and better mechanisms

4773
03:47:05,560 --> 03:47:08,520
that are designed to steal your attention.

4774
03:47:08,520 --> 03:47:10,880
So I kind of see it as a war zone

4775
03:47:10,880 --> 03:47:14,120
between my right for boredom

4776
03:47:15,280 --> 03:47:17,280
and the internet wanting your attention.

4777
03:47:17,280 --> 03:47:22,000
In fact, Clubhouse as an app has been,

4778
03:47:22,000 --> 03:47:24,600
I'm probably not gonna use Clubhouse much anymore.

4779
03:47:24,600 --> 03:47:27,800
There's some aspect of my own inner loneliness

4780
03:47:27,800 --> 03:47:31,160
and whatever it is that pulled me into Clubhouse

4781
03:47:31,160 --> 03:47:33,520
a little bit too much to where it robbed me

4782
03:47:33,520 --> 03:47:36,440
from that lonely time alone

4783
03:47:36,440 --> 03:47:38,120
where I sit and listen to Bruce Springsteen

4784
03:47:38,120 --> 03:47:39,680
and think about life, right?

4785
03:47:39,680 --> 03:47:40,680
So I wanna-

4786
03:47:40,680 --> 03:47:41,720
That's way more important.

4787
03:47:41,720 --> 03:47:44,560
That's way, well, yeah, at least it's all in balance

4788
03:47:44,560 --> 03:47:47,400
because there is a Clubhouse like a lot of these

4789
03:47:47,400 --> 03:47:48,800
social networks when you use right

4790
03:47:48,800 --> 03:47:52,160
can be a way to discover new ideas, new people.

4791
03:47:52,160 --> 03:47:55,920
But the boredom is just being alone with your thoughts

4792
03:47:55,920 --> 03:47:57,320
is priceless.

4793
03:47:57,320 --> 03:47:58,200
Absolutely.

4794
03:47:58,200 --> 03:47:59,560
And you gotta know yourself, right?

4795
03:47:59,560 --> 03:48:03,240
Like it took me a long time to realize I need solitude.

4796
03:48:03,240 --> 03:48:05,360
Like just how I'm wired, how I'm built.

4797
03:48:05,360 --> 03:48:07,440
I need like an hour a day solitude.

4798
03:48:07,440 --> 03:48:08,880
So you gotta listen to that part of yourself.

4799
03:48:08,880 --> 03:48:11,760
You might be compromising something like that

4800
03:48:11,760 --> 03:48:13,000
where you feel like you always need to be

4801
03:48:13,000 --> 03:48:14,600
with your girlfriend or whatever it may be,

4802
03:48:14,600 --> 03:48:18,160
but I would suggest listening to that voice.

4803
03:48:18,160 --> 03:48:20,880
Yeah, I try to remember things

4804
03:48:20,880 --> 03:48:23,040
that made me feel good over time.

4805
03:48:23,040 --> 03:48:25,440
Like long-term had positive impact

4806
03:48:25,440 --> 03:48:27,720
and long-term had negative impact

4807
03:48:27,720 --> 03:48:31,160
and do more of the former and less of the latter.

4808
03:48:31,160 --> 03:48:33,200
We don't often think like that.

4809
03:48:33,200 --> 03:48:35,600
You know, we talked offline about like carnivore diets,

4810
03:48:35,600 --> 03:48:38,920
for example, I try to remember

4811
03:48:38,920 --> 03:48:40,760
that carbs don't make me feel good.

4812
03:48:40,760 --> 03:48:42,000
Yeah.

4813
03:48:42,000 --> 03:48:45,040
In the moment, it's hard to remember that.

4814
03:48:45,040 --> 03:48:47,960
But you have to remember that that's the case.

4815
03:48:47,960 --> 03:48:51,920
And in the same way, exercise,

4816
03:48:51,920 --> 03:48:54,920
it's hard to remember that exercise makes me feel good.

4817
03:48:56,560 --> 03:48:58,040
Especially when it's time to go to the gym.

4818
03:48:58,040 --> 03:48:59,400
Especially when it's time to go to the gym,

4819
03:48:59,400 --> 03:49:00,600
but you should remember that

4820
03:49:00,600 --> 03:49:03,880
because the kind of person you are without exercise,

4821
03:49:03,880 --> 03:49:06,400
for me, just like you beautifully said

4822
03:49:06,400 --> 03:49:07,440
that you have to know yourself.

4823
03:49:07,440 --> 03:49:10,600
The kind of person I am without exercise

4824
03:49:10,600 --> 03:49:15,600
is a less good person, a person I'm less proud of.

4825
03:49:15,680 --> 03:49:16,960
The food thing is so hard.

4826
03:49:16,960 --> 03:49:19,880
By the way, I still, you know,

4827
03:49:19,880 --> 03:49:21,880
I can't tell you how many times I've learned the lesson,

4828
03:49:21,880 --> 03:49:23,560
like don't eat that.

4829
03:49:23,560 --> 03:49:25,200
But then, you know, you go a few weeks

4830
03:49:25,200 --> 03:49:27,000
of not eating whatever that is,

4831
03:49:27,000 --> 03:49:28,320
and you're feeling good.

4832
03:49:28,320 --> 03:49:29,880
And then you're, I don't know,

4833
03:49:29,880 --> 03:49:30,920
something creeps up inside you,

4834
03:49:30,920 --> 03:49:32,240
like, ah, you could just have one,

4835
03:49:32,240 --> 03:49:33,120
or you could just do this.

4836
03:49:33,120 --> 03:49:34,200
But for me, it's sugar.

4837
03:49:34,200 --> 03:49:36,920
Like sugar just makes me feel terrible.

4838
03:49:36,920 --> 03:49:40,080
But I always, not always, but if it's been a long time,

4839
03:49:40,080 --> 03:49:41,600
I start to make that exception in my mind.

4840
03:49:41,600 --> 03:49:43,040
Like, oh, you can have a little bit.

4841
03:49:43,040 --> 03:49:44,160
And then I eat it and I feel terrible.

4842
03:49:44,160 --> 03:49:45,920
So I don't know how many times I've done that dance,

4843
03:49:45,920 --> 03:49:47,440
but it's not cool.

4844
03:49:47,440 --> 03:49:48,800
Well, it depends on how painful it is,

4845
03:49:48,800 --> 03:49:50,000
and then you learn the lesson.

4846
03:49:50,000 --> 03:49:51,840
I actually embraced the fact

4847
03:49:51,840 --> 03:49:54,600
that I'll never learn the lesson with vodka.

4848
03:49:54,600 --> 03:49:57,760
Every time I drink, especially with Russians,

4849
03:49:57,760 --> 03:50:00,320
is like, I quit drinking every time.

4850
03:50:00,320 --> 03:50:02,920
And then I forget, there's like a slow drop-off.

4851
03:50:02,920 --> 03:50:05,040
It'll be like two weeks, and then-

4852
03:50:05,040 --> 03:50:06,120
Na zdorovie.

4853
03:50:06,120 --> 03:50:07,560
Na zdorovie.

4854
03:50:07,560 --> 03:50:08,600
Very good.

4855
03:50:08,600 --> 03:50:12,080
So it never makes you feel good.

4856
03:50:12,080 --> 03:50:13,920
It never results in anything good,

4857
03:50:15,240 --> 03:50:20,080
except the beautiful social chaos,

4858
03:50:20,080 --> 03:50:22,560
which is ultimately somehow,

4859
03:50:22,560 --> 03:50:24,480
there's value to chaos too, you know?

4860
03:50:24,480 --> 03:50:25,760
There's value to that.

4861
03:50:25,760 --> 03:50:27,280
Whatever the hell stupid stuff you do

4862
03:50:27,280 --> 03:50:31,360
when you get trashed, the over-the-top emotion

4863
03:50:31,360 --> 03:50:34,880
of love usually or whatever, camaraderie,

4864
03:50:34,880 --> 03:50:36,200
there's value to that too.

4865
03:50:36,200 --> 03:50:39,600
Like, as I get older, I realize,

4866
03:50:39,600 --> 03:50:43,480
because the world, sometimes,

4867
03:50:43,480 --> 03:50:44,440
especially when you get older

4868
03:50:44,440 --> 03:50:46,320
and the world wants you to be an adult,

4869
03:50:47,560 --> 03:50:49,480
in order to maintain the youthful spirit,

4870
03:50:49,480 --> 03:50:51,440
you have to use all the tools you can.

4871
03:50:51,440 --> 03:50:52,280
Yeah.

4872
03:50:52,280 --> 03:50:53,120
And alcohol is one of them.

4873
03:50:53,120 --> 03:50:53,960
Right.

4874
03:50:53,960 --> 03:50:55,520
To do all the stupid shit you can,

4875
03:50:55,520 --> 03:50:57,960
even if you're like getting older.

4876
03:50:57,960 --> 03:50:59,600
To lower the inhibitions and-

4877
03:50:59,600 --> 03:51:00,440
Lower the inhibitions.

4878
03:51:00,440 --> 03:51:01,960
Again, it's that taste of uncertainty

4879
03:51:01,960 --> 03:51:03,440
that is the sweetness of life, right?

4880
03:51:03,440 --> 03:51:06,520
To be able to go out and be a flaneur at a party

4881
03:51:06,520 --> 03:51:08,160
and not really know what you're gonna do.

4882
03:51:08,160 --> 03:51:12,800
And we have this draw to the wild side of life.

4883
03:51:12,800 --> 03:51:15,400
As much as we try and build up order around ourselves,

4884
03:51:15,400 --> 03:51:18,520
I think there's always gonna be an appetite for that.

4885
03:51:18,520 --> 03:51:21,080
I've always, most of my life,

4886
03:51:21,080 --> 03:51:23,000
I've always been a social drinker,

4887
03:51:23,000 --> 03:51:25,240
but I actually gave up alcohol a year ago.

4888
03:51:25,240 --> 03:51:29,360
And I would add that to the idea,

4889
03:51:30,880 --> 03:51:33,160
the repertoire for dealing with bigger ideas,

4890
03:51:33,160 --> 03:51:35,560
because alcohol is fun.

4891
03:51:35,560 --> 03:51:37,720
It's amazing, good times.

4892
03:51:39,240 --> 03:51:40,640
It can be analgesic.

4893
03:51:40,640 --> 03:51:42,320
It can give you all these benefits

4894
03:51:42,320 --> 03:51:43,880
if you use the right amounts.

4895
03:51:43,880 --> 03:51:46,520
But I got to the point personally

4896
03:51:46,520 --> 03:51:48,400
where I was trying to wrestle with these ideas

4897
03:51:48,400 --> 03:51:50,280
that are just so much bigger than me.

4898
03:51:50,280 --> 03:51:52,400
And I have this backlog of books

4899
03:51:52,400 --> 03:51:55,160
that was growing faster than I could read them

4900
03:51:55,160 --> 03:51:57,320
that I just reached a point where I decided

4901
03:51:58,400 --> 03:52:01,520
I wanted to start making sacrifices toward attaining that.

4902
03:52:01,520 --> 03:52:03,440
And alcohol was just an easy one.

4903
03:52:05,960 --> 03:52:08,160
Even if you just drink socially on the weekends,

4904
03:52:08,160 --> 03:52:12,280
you're probably spending five to 10 hours drinking

4905
03:52:12,280 --> 03:52:13,560
and then maybe another, what,

4906
03:52:13,560 --> 03:52:17,120
five to 10 hours recovering perhaps on the day after.

4907
03:52:19,120 --> 03:52:23,000
So it was a difficult transition initially,

4908
03:52:23,000 --> 03:52:25,880
but once you get through a couple of months,

4909
03:52:25,880 --> 03:52:27,200
I feel amazing without it.

4910
03:52:27,200 --> 03:52:28,760
I sleep better than ever.

4911
03:52:28,760 --> 03:52:30,680
My workouts are better than ever.

4912
03:52:30,680 --> 03:52:31,720
I'm sharper than ever.

4913
03:52:31,720 --> 03:52:33,120
I'm more lucid.

4914
03:52:33,120 --> 03:52:35,920
So I'm not trying to be a proponent for not drinking,

4915
03:52:35,920 --> 03:52:36,760
but I just want to say-

4916
03:52:36,760 --> 03:52:38,320
But you're a proponent for sacrifice in some-

4917
03:52:38,320 --> 03:52:40,920
I am a big proponent for sacrifice, yes.

4918
03:52:40,920 --> 03:52:43,720
Is there advice you would give to a young person today

4919
03:52:43,720 --> 03:52:45,320
curious about Bitcoin,

4920
03:52:45,320 --> 03:52:49,440
curious about how they succeed in the world

4921
03:52:50,640 --> 03:52:55,480
or both career-wise and just in life in general?

4922
03:52:55,480 --> 03:52:58,400
I mean, the strongest piece of advice I have for,

4923
03:52:58,400 --> 03:53:01,080
this is beyond just Bitcoin.

4924
03:53:01,080 --> 03:53:05,880
This is you managing your own personal and financial affairs

4925
03:53:05,880 --> 03:53:09,880
is that you need to invest in knowledge first.

4926
03:53:11,600 --> 03:53:15,640
It's not good enough to just follow the crowd

4927
03:53:15,640 --> 03:53:19,960
and buy a 60-40 portfolio and put it in a Roth RA

4928
03:53:19,960 --> 03:53:22,040
and plan on social security.

4929
03:53:22,040 --> 03:53:25,560
I mean, the world's changing much faster

4930
03:53:25,560 --> 03:53:28,840
than any existing institution

4931
03:53:28,840 --> 03:53:31,040
is going to be able to keep up with.

4932
03:53:31,040 --> 03:53:33,320
So that's why I like,

4933
03:53:33,320 --> 03:53:34,480
I mean, that's why I named the show

4934
03:53:34,480 --> 03:53:35,520
the question, what is money?

4935
03:53:35,520 --> 03:53:38,880
Like, I think that to me is the rabbit

4936
03:53:38,880 --> 03:53:40,080
that took me down the rabbit hole.

4937
03:53:40,080 --> 03:53:42,320
It's like just asking that question

4938
03:53:42,320 --> 03:53:44,920
naturally progressed to these other questions.

4939
03:53:44,920 --> 03:53:46,080
Like what is value?

4940
03:53:46,080 --> 03:53:47,080
What is government?

4941
03:53:47,080 --> 03:53:50,240
What is the purpose of society?

4942
03:53:50,240 --> 03:53:52,240
Speech, all of these things.

4943
03:53:52,240 --> 03:53:57,240
So I would encourage people to arm yourself

4944
03:53:57,360 --> 03:53:58,480
with knowledge and study.

4945
03:53:58,480 --> 03:54:01,480
And like that, a lot of financial people

4946
03:54:01,480 --> 03:54:04,080
always give you a line of advice

4947
03:54:04,080 --> 03:54:05,880
and then say, this is not financial advice.

4948
03:54:05,880 --> 03:54:07,480
Or like, this is financial advice.

4949
03:54:07,480 --> 03:54:10,400
Like study, study, learn.

4950
03:54:11,960 --> 03:54:13,080
Knowledge is power.

4951
03:54:13,080 --> 03:54:13,920
Yeah.

4952
03:54:13,920 --> 03:54:14,920
This is official financial advice.

4953
03:54:14,920 --> 03:54:15,920
Yes.

4954
03:54:15,920 --> 03:54:19,000
And you're exercising your divine trait,

4955
03:54:19,000 --> 03:54:22,200
which is the logos, right?

4956
03:54:22,200 --> 03:54:24,800
That we are these animals

4957
03:54:24,800 --> 03:54:26,320
that can tell and believe stories.

4958
03:54:26,320 --> 03:54:28,800
So it feels like almost a sacred duty

4959
03:54:28,800 --> 03:54:31,520
to really sharpen that part of ourselves

4960
03:54:31,520 --> 03:54:34,000
and use it to create the best world possible.

4961
03:54:36,800 --> 03:54:38,840
And then the second one was the,

4962
03:54:38,840 --> 03:54:40,440
I think, health and fitness stuff.

4963
03:54:40,440 --> 03:54:45,440
I was, maybe everyone does this in their 20s.

4964
03:54:45,800 --> 03:54:47,240
They just live a little fast

4965
03:54:47,240 --> 03:54:49,320
and beat themselves up.

4966
03:54:51,200 --> 03:54:54,000
Not that I wasn't, like I was living well

4967
03:54:54,000 --> 03:54:58,160
and successful by a lot of measures,

4968
03:54:58,160 --> 03:55:00,240
but I wish I had maybe gotten my act together

4969
03:55:00,240 --> 03:55:01,240
a little bit sooner.

4970
03:55:04,280 --> 03:55:05,120
I just think-

4971
03:55:05,120 --> 03:55:07,360
Health-wise, morality-wise.

4972
03:55:07,360 --> 03:55:11,200
Yeah, drinking, I think morality and eating.

4973
03:55:11,200 --> 03:55:13,320
I just was kind of doing whatever I wanted

4974
03:55:13,320 --> 03:55:16,400
in some ways, let's say.

4975
03:55:16,400 --> 03:55:18,040
Is there a value to a trajectory

4976
03:55:18,040 --> 03:55:19,920
that includes a lot of mistakes?

4977
03:55:19,920 --> 03:55:21,840
So maybe you're supposed to make the mistakes

4978
03:55:21,840 --> 03:55:22,680
in your 20s.

4979
03:55:22,680 --> 03:55:23,520
That's a great point, too.

4980
03:55:23,520 --> 03:55:25,520
Maybe the 20s are all about the mistakes.

4981
03:55:25,520 --> 03:55:27,080
Accumulate the most mistakes possible.

4982
03:55:27,080 --> 03:55:28,040
Yeah, I don't-

4983
03:55:28,040 --> 03:55:30,680
As quickly as possible.

4984
03:55:30,680 --> 03:55:32,280
I don't regret any of it,

4985
03:55:32,280 --> 03:55:34,400
but now that I'm kind of in this place

4986
03:55:34,400 --> 03:55:36,680
where I feel good and I know the value

4987
03:55:36,680 --> 03:55:39,200
of a good night's sleep and just,

4988
03:55:39,200 --> 03:55:42,280
I've more deeply explored my own potential

4989
03:55:42,280 --> 03:55:44,160
that I feel maybe a little regretful

4990
03:55:44,160 --> 03:55:46,200
that I didn't do this earlier is all I'm saying.

4991
03:55:46,200 --> 03:55:50,600
So maybe just exploring different sides of yourself.

4992
03:55:50,600 --> 03:55:52,680
See what it's like to go and make a bunch of mistakes

4993
03:55:52,680 --> 03:55:53,960
and be wild and crazy,

4994
03:55:53,960 --> 03:55:55,400
and then maybe try to walk the straight and narrow

4995
03:55:55,400 --> 03:55:58,400
for a few months and just see what it's like.

4996
03:55:58,400 --> 03:56:02,160
There's probably a guy doing vodka shots right now

4997
03:56:02,160 --> 03:56:04,000
listening to this podcast with his buddies,

4998
03:56:04,000 --> 03:56:07,560
and if you are, please take a shot for us

4999
03:56:07,560 --> 03:56:11,240
for all the mistakes you should make in your 20s.

5000
03:56:11,240 --> 03:56:15,640
And what about love?

5001
03:56:18,040 --> 03:56:21,920
We talked about money is ultimately a mechanism

5002
03:56:21,920 --> 03:56:26,920
by which you can pave a moral path through life.

5003
03:56:29,680 --> 03:56:31,760
To me, one of the purest expressions

5004
03:56:31,760 --> 03:56:34,560
that is love broadly defined for a family,

5005
03:56:34,560 --> 03:56:38,120
for others, for knowledge, for the world,

5006
03:56:38,120 --> 03:56:40,880
is basically an optimistic open view to the world

5007
03:56:40,880 --> 03:56:44,840
that embraces all that is beautiful about this world.

5008
03:56:44,840 --> 03:56:49,280
So do you think about love often?

5009
03:56:49,280 --> 03:56:52,880
In a personal sense, romantic, family, friendship,

5010
03:56:52,880 --> 03:56:54,960
and in the broad sense,

5011
03:56:54,960 --> 03:56:58,440
about its value in a successful life?

5012
03:56:59,920 --> 03:57:01,480
Yeah, of course.

5013
03:57:01,480 --> 03:57:04,640
I'm blessed to have a two and a half year old daughter,

5014
03:57:04,640 --> 03:57:09,200
and love is a word we throw around.

5015
03:57:09,200 --> 03:57:11,440
I love these potato chips, I love you, man.

5016
03:57:11,440 --> 03:57:12,800
I love you, my daughter.

5017
03:57:12,800 --> 03:57:15,600
It's got so many different intensities,

5018
03:57:15,600 --> 03:57:16,640
I guess you might say.

5019
03:57:19,880 --> 03:57:21,960
I don't know, my intuition is that

5020
03:57:23,520 --> 03:57:27,240
it is something very fundamental to the universe.

5021
03:57:27,240 --> 03:57:29,160
Again, I know words don't do it justice,

5022
03:57:29,160 --> 03:57:33,320
but if we just proxy love with selfless action,

5023
03:57:34,360 --> 03:57:38,440
the whole damn universe is selflessly acting, right?

5024
03:57:38,440 --> 03:57:39,800
It's just unfolding.

5025
03:57:39,800 --> 03:57:43,760
And it may sound a bit hippy dippy,

5026
03:57:43,760 --> 03:57:45,200
but my intuition is just that love

5027
03:57:45,200 --> 03:57:47,520
is the core of it somehow.

5028
03:57:48,920 --> 03:57:51,960
I don't have anything to back that up, really, it's just.

5029
03:57:51,960 --> 03:57:55,160
In the way you're framing it, it's making me think

5030
03:57:55,160 --> 03:57:59,680
that love, we talked about sort of meditation,

5031
03:58:02,800 --> 03:58:05,720
as opposed to thinking from an egocentric perspective

5032
03:58:05,720 --> 03:58:08,280
of you, the individual operating in this world,

5033
03:58:08,280 --> 03:58:11,000
is allowing you to be empathetic towards the world

5034
03:58:11,000 --> 03:58:13,480
and thereby think of the universe,

5035
03:58:13,480 --> 03:58:15,880
think of the world acting through you.

5036
03:58:15,880 --> 03:58:20,720
Almost like accepting this notion that ideas have you,

5037
03:58:20,720 --> 03:58:21,840
you don't have ideas,

5038
03:58:22,840 --> 03:58:25,280
that you're not existing in the universe,

5039
03:58:25,280 --> 03:58:27,280
the universe is existing through you.

5040
03:58:27,280 --> 03:58:32,280
It's sort of like, that's what selfless in that context means,

5041
03:58:32,440 --> 03:58:34,640
is like embracing that thought.

5042
03:58:34,640 --> 03:58:36,600
That's a weird thought.

5043
03:58:36,600 --> 03:58:38,200
It's a weird thought that we're just here

5044
03:58:38,200 --> 03:58:43,200
for a little bit of time, these meat vehicles, receptacles,

5045
03:58:45,160 --> 03:58:50,160
and this much bigger thing is just using us,

5046
03:58:51,600 --> 03:58:56,040
not in a malevolent way, but just like a river flows,

5047
03:58:56,040 --> 03:58:59,240
is using us to create more and more beautiful things.

5048
03:58:59,240 --> 03:59:02,000
Yes, yes, more and more beautiful things.

5049
03:59:02,000 --> 03:59:06,160
We are the universe experiencing itself, frankly, right?

5050
03:59:06,160 --> 03:59:07,000
So-

5051
03:59:07,000 --> 03:59:08,200
That's a trippy thought, man.

5052
03:59:08,200 --> 03:59:09,520
Yeah.

5053
03:59:09,520 --> 03:59:12,240
That in some sense, the universe created us

5054
03:59:12,240 --> 03:59:13,840
to experience itself.

5055
03:59:13,840 --> 03:59:17,840
And we are one of the highest forms of beauty

5056
03:59:17,840 --> 03:59:19,320
that nature has created, right?

5057
03:59:19,320 --> 03:59:24,320
If we just think one of the most complex and adaptive thing,

5058
03:59:25,200 --> 03:59:26,680
we're a reflection of nature.

5059
03:59:26,680 --> 03:59:30,480
And another thing that comes to mind here is that

5060
03:59:30,480 --> 03:59:35,480
Dalio has this quote where he says, truth or more accurately,

5061
03:59:36,440 --> 03:59:39,640
an accurate depiction of reality is necessary

5062
03:59:39,640 --> 03:59:41,240
for any good outcome.

5063
03:59:42,440 --> 03:59:47,440
So when we think that love or value is primary,

5064
03:59:47,440 --> 03:59:49,920
I think that too reinforces this thesis

5065
03:59:49,920 --> 03:59:54,880
that acting out of love or acting out of proper moral action,

5066
03:59:54,880 --> 03:59:58,360
you're best reflecting the fundamental nature of reality.

5067
03:59:58,360 --> 04:00:01,080
Therefore, you're best creating the best possible outcomes

5068
04:00:01,080 --> 04:00:02,280
or the things of the most beauty,

5069
04:00:02,280 --> 04:00:05,000
whether that's your artistic expression, your children,

5070
04:00:05,000 --> 04:00:06,560
your business, whatever it is.

5071
04:00:08,040 --> 04:00:09,680
And Jordan Peterson goes deep into that

5072
04:00:09,680 --> 04:00:12,720
where you have to listen to that sense of meaning

5073
04:00:12,720 --> 04:00:15,320
in your life, or you might have some decision on paper

5074
04:00:15,320 --> 04:00:18,360
that's so great this way, but your heart says no,

5075
04:00:18,360 --> 04:00:19,640
your heart says otherwise.

5076
04:00:22,080 --> 04:00:24,240
I've tried to listen to my heart throughout

5077
04:00:24,240 --> 04:00:26,520
and I think that creates the best outcomes.

5078
04:00:26,520 --> 04:00:30,280
But nevertheless, does it make you sad

5079
04:00:30,280 --> 04:00:34,440
that you in particular, Robert,

5080
04:00:34,440 --> 04:00:36,120
are gonna be dead pretty soon?

5081
04:00:38,200 --> 04:00:42,280
As we talk about scarcity, one of the certain things

5082
04:00:42,280 --> 04:00:45,960
that ensure the scarcity of the human experience

5083
04:00:45,960 --> 04:00:48,480
is the fact that you and your consciousness

5084
04:00:48,480 --> 04:00:51,520
are gonna be done, they have a deadline.

5085
04:00:51,520 --> 04:00:54,360
Only time and Bitcoin are absolutely scarce.

5086
04:00:54,360 --> 04:00:59,360
I'm fortunate, I guess I got started

5087
04:01:03,280 --> 04:01:05,560
on this philosophical journey a bit when I was younger,

5088
04:01:05,560 --> 04:01:09,880
but I got into Musashi and Sun Tzu quite a bit,

5089
04:01:11,360 --> 04:01:13,880
who wrote, Musashi wrote the book of five rings,

5090
04:01:16,240 --> 04:01:17,440
Sun Tzu wrote the art of war.

5091
04:01:17,440 --> 04:01:19,960
And one of the things that, I mean,

5092
04:01:19,960 --> 04:01:22,920
these guys were just absolute beasts,

5093
04:01:22,920 --> 04:01:24,480
they lived and died by the sword

5094
04:01:24,480 --> 04:01:28,920
and they were just very great equanimity

5095
04:01:28,920 --> 04:01:30,280
about all things in life.

5096
04:01:30,280 --> 04:01:32,920
And I also found this kind of in the stoic philosophy

5097
04:01:32,920 --> 04:01:37,480
where they just are very cool with everything.

5098
04:01:37,480 --> 04:01:40,600
And one of the lines there is that the way of the warrior

5099
04:01:40,600 --> 04:01:42,480
is the resolute acceptance of death.

5100
04:01:43,600 --> 04:01:45,160
And so I've always tried to think about that.

5101
04:01:45,160 --> 04:01:46,960
Like, of course I experienced fear,

5102
04:01:46,960 --> 04:01:51,840
I experienced everything that you do in a meat suit, right?

5103
04:01:51,840 --> 04:01:53,320
Like anxiety and all the things,

5104
04:01:53,320 --> 04:01:58,320
but I always try to have that higher order view of myself

5105
04:01:58,360 --> 04:02:02,680
and that it's just a certain experience occurring

5106
04:02:02,680 --> 04:02:03,720
at a certain level,

5107
04:02:03,720 --> 04:02:07,000
but it shouldn't override your kind of highest order self.

5108
04:02:07,000 --> 04:02:09,760
That's just resolutely accepted death

5109
04:02:09,760 --> 04:02:13,560
and that this is your one play in life.

5110
04:02:13,560 --> 04:02:18,560
So hopefully that propels me towards proper action.

5111
04:02:18,560 --> 04:02:23,560
I think scarcity cannot help, but lead to something good.

5112
04:02:25,080 --> 04:02:26,800
Just like with this conversation,

5113
04:02:26,800 --> 04:02:29,320
sadly must come to an end.

5114
04:02:29,320 --> 04:02:31,440
The scarcity of it is what makes it beautiful.

5115
04:02:31,440 --> 04:02:34,920
So Robert, this was one of my favorite conversations

5116
04:02:35,960 --> 04:02:40,080
philosophically and in every other level,

5117
04:02:40,080 --> 04:02:44,400
just the ideas and the way you express them around Bitcoin,

5118
04:02:44,400 --> 04:02:47,140
around morality, around money.

5119
04:02:47,140 --> 04:02:51,300
Has been really inspiring and really educational.

5120
04:02:51,300 --> 04:02:54,140
And I'm glad you're out there fighting the good fight.

5121
04:02:54,140 --> 04:02:57,060
And I'm glad you wasting all of this time with me.

5122
04:02:57,060 --> 04:02:58,380
It was really fun.

5123
04:02:58,380 --> 04:03:01,700
And thank you for coming down to Texas

5124
04:03:01,700 --> 04:03:05,060
and having some good old brisket together.

5125
04:03:05,060 --> 04:03:06,620
This was really fun then.

5126
04:03:06,620 --> 04:03:07,940
This was awesome.

5127
04:03:07,940 --> 04:03:10,020
Thanks for having me, man.

5128
04:03:10,020 --> 04:03:11,700
Thanks for listening to this conversation

5129
04:03:11,700 --> 04:03:13,060
with Robert Breedlove.

5130
04:03:13,060 --> 04:03:18,060
And thank you to Fundrise, Element, Mugpack and BetterHelp.

5131
04:03:18,540 --> 04:03:21,980
Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

5132
04:03:21,980 --> 04:03:24,060
And now let me leave you with some words

5133
04:03:24,060 --> 04:03:26,500
from Nassim Nicholas Taleb.

5134
04:03:26,500 --> 04:03:30,020
Anti-fragility is beyond resilience and robustness.

5135
04:03:30,020 --> 04:03:33,700
The resilient resists shocks and stay the same.

5136
04:03:33,700 --> 04:03:36,300
The anti-fragile gets better.

5137
04:03:36,300 --> 04:03:42,300
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
