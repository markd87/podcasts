For example, he didn't specify the knowledge that the expert or judge would have, <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gfr50f6ZBvo&t=164' target='__blank'>00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,360</a> not how much time would they have to investigate this. These are important parameters, <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gfr50f6ZBvo&t=169' target='__blank'>00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:57,680</a> if you're going to make it a true formal test. By some measures, people claim the touring test <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gfr50f6ZBvo&t=177' target='__blank'>00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:04,160</a> passed several decades ago.

I think for its time, it was an amazing <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gfr50f6ZBvo&t=224' target='__blank'>00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,280</a> thought experiment, and also 1950s, obviously, it was barely the dawn of the computer age. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gfr50f6ZBvo&t=229' target='__blank'>00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,840</a> So of course, he only thought about text, and now we have a lot more different inputs. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gfr50f6ZBvo&t=233' target='__blank'>00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:59,440</a> So yeah, maybe the better thing to test is the generalizability, so across multiple tasks, <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gfr50f6ZBvo&t=239' target='__blank'>00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:06,560</a> but I think it's also possible, as systems like God will show, that eventually that might <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gfr50f6ZBvo&t=246' target='__blank'>00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,440</a> map right back to language.

Yeah, I think certainly <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gfr50f6ZBvo&t=283' target='__blank'>00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:50,000</a> we as humans use language as our main generalization communication tool.

So it's going to be very powerful <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gfr50f6ZBvo&t=297' target='__blank'>00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:04,400</a> mode in which to explain the system to explain what it's doing, but I don't think it's the only <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gfr50f6ZBvo&t=305' target='__blank'>00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,640</a> modality that matters. So I think there's going to be a lot of, you know, there's a lot of different <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gfr50f6ZBvo&t=310' target='__blank'>00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:18,480</a> ways to express capabilities other than just language. Yeah, visual, robotics, body language, <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gfr50f6ZBvo&t=318' target='__blank'>00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:25,280</a> yeah, actions, the interactive aspect of all that, that's all part of it. But what's interesting <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gfr50f6ZBvo&t=325' target='__blank'>00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:31,760</a> with Gato is that it's sort of pushing prediction to the maximum in terms of like, you know, <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gfr50f6ZBvo&t=331' target='__blank'>00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:36,080</a> mapping arbitrary sequences to other sequences and sort of just predicting what's going to happen <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gfr50f6ZBvo&t=336' target='__blank'>00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:43,120</a> next. So prediction seems to be fundamental to intelligence. And what you're predicting doesn't <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gfr50f6ZBvo&t=343' target='__blank'>00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,520</a> so much matter. Yeah, it seems like you can generalize that quite well. So obviously, language <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gfr50f6ZBvo&t=347' target='__blank'>00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:54,400</a> models predict the next word. Gato predicts potentially any action or any token. And it's just <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gfr50f6ZBvo&t=354' target='__blank'>00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,360</a> the beginning really. So I'm most general agent. One could call it so far, but, you know, that <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gfr50f6ZBvo&t=359' target='__blank'>00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,880</a> itself can be scaled up massively more than we've done so far. And obviously, we're in the <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gfr50f6ZBvo&t=362' target='__blank'>00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:08,400</a> in the middle of doing that. But the big part of solving AGI is creating benchmarks that <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gfr50f6ZBvo&t=369' target='__blank'>00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,960</a> help us get closer and closer sort of creating benchmarks that test the generalizability. And <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gfr50f6ZBvo&t=374' target='__blank'>00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:21,040</a> it's just still interesting that this fellow Alan Turing was one of the first and probably <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gfr50f6ZBvo&t=381' target='__blank'>00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:26,080</a> still one of the only people that was trying maybe philosophically, but was trying to formulate <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gfr50f6ZBvo&t=386' target='__blank'>00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:32,400</a> a benchmark that could be followed.

And I still think something like the Turing test will end at the end <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gfr50f6ZBvo&t=397' target='__blank'>00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:44,080</a> of the day be the thing that truly impresses other humans so that you can have a close friend <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gfr50f6ZBvo&t=404' target='__blank'>00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:49,600</a> who's an AI system.

They all enhance our natural <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gfr50f6ZBvo&t=596' target='__blank'>00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:02,640</a> capabilities.

So, when did you first start to gain an understanding <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gfr50f6ZBvo&t=656' target='__blank'>00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:02,720</a> that you can not just write programs that do some mathematical operations for you while you sleep, <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gfr50f6ZBvo&t=662' target='__blank'>00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:11,360</a> but something that's a keen to bringing an entity to life, sort of a thing that can figure out <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gfr50f6ZBvo&t=671' target='__blank'>00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:17,200</a> something more complicated than a simple mathematical operation?

So, that dream was there to try to get to the highest level of chess. Yeah, so, <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gfr50f6ZBvo&t=695' target='__blank'>00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,400</a> I was, you know, I got to, when I was about 12 years old, I got to Master Standard and I was <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gfr50f6ZBvo&t=700' target='__blank'>00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:44,640</a> second highest rated player in the world to Judith Polga, who obviously ended up being an amazing <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gfr50f6ZBvo&t=704' target='__blank'>00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:51,280</a> chess player and a world women's champion.

So Alpha Go was a learning <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gfr50f6ZBvo&t=2919' target='__blank'>00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:44,160</a> system, but it was specifically trained to only play Go, right? So and what we wanted to do in <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gfr50f6ZBvo&t=2924' target='__blank'>00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:48,880</a> with first version of Alpha Go is just get to world champion performance no matter how we did it, <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gfr50f6ZBvo&t=2928' target='__blank'>00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:54,240</a> right?

So it could just play against itself from random starting point from <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gfr50f6ZBvo&t=2939' target='__blank'>00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:04,960</a> the beginning. So that removed the need for human knowledge about Go. And then finally Alpha Zero <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gfr50f6ZBvo&t=2944' target='__blank'>00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:10,000</a> then generalized it so that any things we had in there, the system, including things like symmetry <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gfr50f6ZBvo&t=2950' target='__blank'>00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:15,520</a> of the Go board, were removed.
