And he teaches young Jim when he's a child <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=430' target='__blank'>00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:16,540</a> here in the factory to say Russian phrases like, give me a cigarette and kiss my ass. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=437' target='__blank'>00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,340</a> Which I think he probably would say that thousands of times the rest of his life. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=440' target='__blank'>00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:25,460</a> I think so. If you watch interviews with Jim, his hands are always twitching, <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=445' target='__blank'>00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:30,840</a> because he has chain-smoked his entire life, probably going back to, like, age 10 in the <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=450' target='__blank'>00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:36,520</a> factory. Three packs of merits a day. Unbelievable. Although I think he quit later in life, but he <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=456' target='__blank'>00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:40,000</a> definitely chain-smoked the better part of the first, call it, 75 years or something. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=460' target='__blank'>00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:45,020</a> I mean, these famous stories of the conference rooms at Rentech and the war rooms when the <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=465' target='__blank'>00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:49,300</a> market is going through, like, a crazy gyration and it's just filled with cigarette smoke and <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=469' target='__blank'>00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:55,520</a> it's all Jim. Different time. Different time. So back to Jim's childhood, though, here in the, <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=475' target='__blank'>00:07:55,540 --> 00:08:02,480</a> like, Boston suburbs. He grows up certainly not uber-wealthy or uber-rich, but very, very solidly <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=482' target='__blank'>00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:07,240</a> upper-middle class. And especially, he's an only child. He has all the resources of his parents, <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=487' target='__blank'>00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:12,420</a> his family, his grandfather's this sort of well-to-do entrepreneur. And Jim, you know, <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=492' target='__blank'>00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:18,840</a> he gets to rub shoulders in the Boston area with people who are really rich. And he says later, <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=499' target='__blank'>00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,340</a> I observed that it's very nice to be rich. I had no interest in business, which is not to say I <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=504' target='__blank'>00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,500</a> had no interest in money. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=506' target='__blank'>00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,000</a> Yes. Important to tease out the difference between those two things. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=509' target='__blank'>00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:33,900</a> Yes. Very, very important. And what he means when he says he has no interest in business, <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=514' target='__blank'>00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:41,280</a> it's because from a pretty young age, he gets really into math. So the legend has it when Jim <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=521' target='__blank'>00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:46,800</a> is four years old, he stumbles into one of Zeno's famous paradoxes from ancient Greek times. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=527' target='__blank'>00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:53,000</a> Yep. This is great. The basic gist of Zeno's paradox is if you are always taking a quantity <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=533' target='__blank'>00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,520</a> and dividing it by two, you will never get the same amount of money. And that's why he's so <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=536' target='__blank'>00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:01,240</a> zero. You will asymptotically approach zero, but you will never actually touch zero. You need to do <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=541' target='__blank'>00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:06,420</a> addition or subtraction to do that. Division won't cut it. And so Jim, as a four-year-old, <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=546' target='__blank'>00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:11,840</a> when he observes they need to go to the gas station to fill up the tank, he throws out the idea, <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=552' target='__blank'>00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:18,180</a> well, let's just use only half the gas in the tank because then we'll still be able to after <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=558' target='__blank'>00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:21,940</a> that only use half the gas in the tank. And, you know, the funny thing that doesn't occur to a <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=561' target='__blank'>00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:24,780</a> four-year-old is, well, then we're just not going to get very far. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=564' target='__blank'>00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:31,520</a> So Jim's dream is to go to MIT down the street in Cambridge and study math. He graduates high <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=571' target='__blank'>00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:36,580</a> school in three years. And during the second semester of Jim's freshman year there, he <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=576' target='__blank'>00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:42,360</a> enrolls in a graduate math seminar on abstract algebra. So pretty, you know, heady stuff. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=582' target='__blank'>00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:48,580</a> Yeah. And Jim would go on to finish his undergrad at MIT in three years and get a master's in one <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=588' target='__blank'>00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:54,640</a> year. Yeah. Pretty, pretty smart. But it turns out that that freshman year grad seminar, <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=594' target='__blank'>00:09:54,640 --> 00:10:01,020</a> he took, actually has a big impact on him because he doesn't do well in the class. He can't keep up. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=601' target='__blank'>00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:08,220</a> And Jim's pretty self-aware here. There are other people at MIT who never run into problems. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=608' target='__blank'>00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:14,840</a> They never hit a limit. They never struggle understanding any concept. And he realizes that, <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=615' target='__blank'>00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,480</a> oh, I'm smart. I'm very, very smart. I'm smarter than most other people here. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=619' target='__blank'>00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,000</a> But I'm not one of those people. Right. Which is, you know, <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=624' target='__blank'>00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,620</a> what do you do with that? <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=624' target='__blank'>00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:29,780</a> You realize you have to add a few of your skills together to become the best at something. You have <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=629' target='__blank'>00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:34,480</a> to be smart and something else. Yes. So Jim's own words on this are, <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=634' target='__blank'>00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:38,580</a> I was a good mathematician. I wasn't the greatest in the world, but I was pretty good. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=638' target='__blank'>00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,820</a> But he recognizes, like you said, Ben, that he has a different advantage <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=641' target='__blank'>00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:47,580</a> that most of the super geniuses lacked. And that's that, as he put it, he had good taste. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=647' target='__blank'>00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:53,760</a> So these are his words. Taste in science is very important. To distinguish what's a good problem <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=653' target='__blank'>00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,200</a> and what's a problem that's not, that's not true. And that's the best advantage that Jim has. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=654' target='__blank'>00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:59,140</a> what's a problem that no one's going to care about the answer to anyway. That's taste. And I think I <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=659' target='__blank'>00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:06,100</a> have good taste. By the way, this is exactly the same thing as Jeff Bezos in college realizing he <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=666' target='__blank'>00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:12,120</a> wanted to be a theoretical physicist. He met some of the extreme brainpower people that would go on <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=672' target='__blank'>00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:16,240</a> to become the best theoretical physicist in the world. And he said, I'm smart, but I'm not that <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=676' target='__blank'>00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:23,760</a> smart. And so switch to computer science. I think the analogy here is like sports. There are all <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=683' target='__blank'>00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:30,700</a> star players. There are Hall of Famers. And then there's LeBron and MJ. And Jim ends up being a <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=690' target='__blank'>00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:35,560</a> Hall of Famer mathematician, but he's not Tom Brady. I mean, he's got a pretty important theorem <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=695' target='__blank'>00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:39,880</a> named after him. That goes on to become a foundation of string theory and physics, which <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=699' target='__blank'>00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:46,520</a> isn't even Jim's field. Crazy. So this realization that Jim has about himself, though, both that he's <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=706' target='__blank'>00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:52,680</a> not the smartest person in the room at a place like MIT, but he can hang with them and that he <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=712' target='__blank'>00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,400</a> has this. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=713' target='__blank'>00:11:53,760 --> 00:12:00,760</a> Taste concept, I think, becomes one of the most important keys to the secret sauce that ends up <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=720' target='__blank'>00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:07,460</a> getting built at Rentech, which is that he can relate to everybody. He understands what's going <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=727' target='__blank'>00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:11,820</a> on. Any person off the street probably couldn't even really have a conversation with these folks, <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=732' target='__blank'>00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:18,340</a> but he can. And yet he also has the perspective. Maybe some of this is from his grandfather of <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=738' target='__blank'>00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:23,740</a> what is important out there in the real world. And as a result, all of his friends at MIT, <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=743' target='__blank'>00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:30,020</a> and these super smart people, they look up to him because you aren't like the kid in the corner at <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=750' target='__blank'>00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:34,020</a> the high school dance. You're cool. He's the extroverted theoretical mathematician. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=754' target='__blank'>00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:40,660</a> Yes. So he was elected class president in high school. You know, he smokes cigarettes. He's <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=760' target='__blank'>00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:46,060</a> popular with the ladies. He kind of looks like Humphrey Bogart. He's a popular dude, <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=766' target='__blank'>00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:50,180</a> especially at this point in time. We're now in the late 50s when Jim's at MIT. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=770' target='__blank'>00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:53,740</a> You know, this is kind of James Dean rebel without a cause. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=773' target='__blank'>00:12:53,760 --> 00:13:02,100</a> Yep. So after graduation, Jim leads his buddies on a road trip with motor scooters. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=782' target='__blank'>00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:07,600</a> You can't make this stuff up from Boston down to Bogota, where one of his classmates is from. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=787' target='__blank'>00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:11,980</a> The idea is that they're going to do something so epic that the newspapers are going to have <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=791' target='__blank'>00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:17,460</a> to write about it.

They get <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I&t=797' target='__blank'>00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:21,920</a> into all sorts of adventures.

target='__blank'>01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:58,260</a> So, they just backed into the management fee based on like, hey, we need $800,000 a year to run the infrastructure. <br/></body></html><a

should be able to massively outperform the market doing quantitative trading, well, we're going to need a lot of fees to do that. <br/></body></html><a
