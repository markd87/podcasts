href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=58' target='__blank'>00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:04,680</a> What is a neural network and why does it seem to do such a surprisingly good job of learning?

href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=65' target='__blank'>00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:12,760</a> It's a mathematical abstraction of the brain, I would say that's how it was originally developed. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=72' target='__blank'>00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,700</a> At the end of the day, it's a mathematical expression and it's a fairly simple mathematical <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=75' target='__blank'>00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,580</a> expression when you get down to it. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=77' target='__blank'>00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:23,760</a> It's basically a sequence of matrix multiplies, which are really dot products mathematically, <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=83' target='__blank'>00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,400</a> and some nonlinearities thrown in.

it. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=89' target='__blank'>00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:30,460</a> Many knobs. <br/></body></html><a

target='__blank'>00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:35,000</a> And these knobs are loosely related to basically the synapses in your brain, they're trainable, <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=95' target='__blank'>00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000</a> they're modifiable. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=96' target='__blank'>00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,600</a> And so the idea is like, we need to find the setting of the knobs that makes the neural

<br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=107' target='__blank'>00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,600</a> You might think that, basically don't want to endow it with too much meaning with respect <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=110' target='__blank'>00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:54,920</a> to the brain and how it works, it's really just a complicated mathematical expression <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=114' target='__blank'>00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,840</a> with knobs and those knobs need a proper setting for it to do something desirable. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=118' target='__blank'>00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:04,320</a> Yeah, but poetry is just the collection of letters with spaces, but it can make us feel <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=124' target='__blank'>00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,320</a> a certain way. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=125' target='__blank'>00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:10,160</a> And in that same way, when you get a large number of knobs together, whether it's inside <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=130' target='__blank'>00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:16,160</a> the brain or inside a computer, they seem to surprise us with their power. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=136' target='__blank'>00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,160</a> Yeah. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=137' target='__blank'>00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,160</a> And that's fair. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=138' target='__blank'>00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,960</a> So basically, I'm underselling it by a lot because you definitely do get very surprising <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=142' target='__blank'>00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:27,740</a> emergent behaviors out of these neural nets when they're large enough and trained on complicated <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=147' target='__blank'>00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:28,740</a> enough problems. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=148' target='__blank'>00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:33,920</a> Like say, for example, the next word prediction in a massive data set from the internet. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=153' target='__blank'>00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,240</a> And then these neural nets take on pretty surprising magical properties. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=157' target='__blank'>00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:41,720</a> Yeah, I think it's kind of interesting how much you can get out of even very simple mathematical <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=161' target='__blank'>00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,720</a> formalism.

prediction? <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=166' target='__blank'>00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,800</a> Or is it doing something more interesting? <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=168' target='__blank'>00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,840</a> Well, it's definitely some kind of a generative model that's a GPT-like and prompted by you. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=173' target='__blank'>00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,840</a> Yeah. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=174' target='__blank'>00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,840</a> So you're giving me a prompt and I'm kind of like responding to it in a generative way. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=178' target='__blank'>00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,000</a> And by yourself, perhaps a little bit? <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=181' target='__blank'>00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,800</a> Like are you adding extra prompts from your own memory inside your head? <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=185' target='__blank'>00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,800</a> Or no? <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=186' target='__blank'>00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,920</a> Well, it definitely feels like you're referencing some kind of a declarative structure of like <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=190' target='__blank'>00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:16,360</a> memory and so on, and then you're putting that together with your prompt and giving <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=196' target='__blank'>00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,360</a> away some answers. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=197' target='__blank'>00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,560</a> Like how much of what you just said has been said by you before? <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=201' target='__blank'>00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,560</a> Nothing, basically, right? <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=203' target='__blank'>00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:28,040</a> No, but if you actually look at all the words you've ever said in your life, and you do <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=208' target='__blank'>00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:33,920</a> a search, you'll probably have said a lot of the same words in the same order before. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=213' target='__blank'>00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,920</a> Yeah, could be. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=214' target='__blank'>00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,600</a> I mean, I'm using phrases that are common, etc. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=217' target='__blank'>00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:42,160</a> But I'm remixing it into a pretty sort of unique sentence at the end of the day. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=222' target='__blank'>00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,160</a> But you're right, definitely. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=223' target='__blank'>00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,160</a> There's like a ton of remixing. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=224' target='__blank'>00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:52,400</a> It's like Magnus Carlsen said, I'm rated 2900 whatever, which is pretty decent. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=232' target='__blank'>00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:58,240</a> I think you're talking very, you're not giving enough credit to neural nets here. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=238' target='__blank'>00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:05,000</a> Why do they seem to, what's your best intuition about this emergent behavior? <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=245' target='__blank'>00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,040</a> I mean, it's kind of interesting because I'm simultaneously underselling them. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=249' target='__blank'>00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,320</a> But I also feel like there's an element to which I'm over, like, it's actually kind of <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=252' target='__blank'>00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,760</a> incredible that you can get so much emergent magical behavior out of them, despite them <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=255' target='__blank'>00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,680</a> being so simple mathematically. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=257' target='__blank'>00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,820</a> So I think those are kind of like two surprising statements that are kind of juxtaposed together. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=262' target='__blank'>00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:26,240</a> And I think basically what it is, is we are actually fairly good at optimizing these neural <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=266'

href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=2320' target='__blank'>00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:46,000</a> So basically a transformer is a series of blocks, right? <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=2326' target='__blank'>00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,760</a> And these blocks have a tension and a little multi-layer perceptron. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=2328' target='__blank'>00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:52,640</a> And so you go off into a block and you come back to this residual pathway, and then you

href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=2333' target='__blank'>00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:56,160</a> And then you have a number of layers arranged sequentially. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=2336' target='__blank'>00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:00,160</a> And so the way to look at it, I think, is because of the residual pathway in the backward

that in the beginning, during initialization, <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=2358' target='__blank'>00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:21,600</a> they contribute nothing

the transformer is kind of like a Python function, <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=2366' target='__blank'>00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,240</a> like a dev.
