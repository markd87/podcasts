it was originally <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=71' target='__blank'>00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,320</a> developed. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=72' target='__blank'>00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,120</a> At the end of the day, it's a mathematical expression and it's a fairly simple mathematical

href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=77' target='__blank'>00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:23,480</a> It's basically a sequence of matrix multiplies, which are really dot products mathematically

href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=85' target='__blank'>00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,480</a> And so it's a very simple mathematical expression and it's got knobs in it. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=89' target='__blank'>00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,480</a> Many knobs. <br/></body></html><a

target='__blank'>00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,280</a> And these knobs are loosely related to basically the synapses in your brain. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=94' target='__blank'>00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,280</a> They're trainable. <br/></body></html><a

href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=96' target='__blank'>00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:40,480</a> And so the idea is we need to find the setting of the knobs that makes the neural net do

think that basically <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=108' target='__blank'>00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,640</a> don't want to end out with too much meaning with respect to the brain and how it works. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=112' target='__blank'>00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,280</a> It's really just a complicated mathematical expression with knobs and those knobs need <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=116' target='__blank'>00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,120</a> a proper setting for it to do something desirable. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=119' target='__blank'>00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:04,320</a> Yeah, but poetry is just the collection of letters with spaces, but it can make us feel <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=124' target='__blank'>00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,320</a> a certain way. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=125' target='__blank'>00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:10,200</a> In that same way, when you get a large number of knobs together, whether it's inside <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=130' target='__blank'>00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:16,120</a> the brain or inside a computer, they seem to, they seem to surprise us with their power. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=136' target='__blank'>00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,520</a> Yeah, I think that's fair. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=137' target='__blank'>00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:23,800</a> So basically I'm underselling it by a lot because you definitely do get very surprising emergent <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=143' target='__blank'>00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:27,760</a> behaviors out of these neural nets when they're large enough and trained on complicated <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=147' target='__blank'>00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,760</a> enough problems.

from the internet. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=153' target='__blank'>00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,240</a> And then these neural nets take on a pretty surprising magical properties. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=157' target='__blank'>00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:41,520</a> Yeah, I think it's kind of interesting how much you can get out of even very simple mathematical <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=161' target='__blank'>00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,520</a> formalism.

or is it doing something <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=168' target='__blank'>00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000</a> more interesting? <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=169' target='__blank'>00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,040</a> Well, it's definitely some kind of a generative model that's a GPT-like and prompted by <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=173' target='__blank'>00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,040</a> you. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=174' target='__blank'>00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,040</a> Yeah. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=175' target='__blank'>00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,880</a> So you're giving me a prompt and I'm kind of like responding to it in a generative way. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=178' target='__blank'>00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:04,120</a> And by yourself, perhaps a little bit like are you adding extra prompts from your own <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=184' target='__blank'>00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,920</a> memory inside your head? <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=185' target='__blank'>00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,920</a> Or no? <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=186' target='__blank'>00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:11,000</a> Well, definitely feels like you're referencing some kind of a declarative structure of like <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=191' target='__blank'>00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,520</a> memory and so on. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=192' target='__blank'>00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:17,240</a> And then you're putting that together with your prompt and giving away some answers.

href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=203' target='__blank'>00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:28,120</a> No, but if you actually look at all the words you've ever said in your life and you do

order before. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=213' target='__blank'>00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,960</a> Yeah. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=214' target='__blank'>00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:40,480</a> I mean, I'm using phrases that are common, et cetera, but I'm remixing it into a pretty

href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=222' target='__blank'>00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,160</a> But you're right. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=223' target='__blank'>00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,160</a> Definitely. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=224' target='__blank'>00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,160</a> There's like a ton of remixing. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=225' target='__blank'>00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,160</a> Why? <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=226' target='__blank'>00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,160</a> You didn't. <br/></body></html><a

nets here. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=238' target='__blank'>00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,000</a> Why do they seem to? <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=241' target='__blank'>00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,640</a> What's your best intuition about this emergent behavior? <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=245' target='__blank'>00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:09,080</a> I mean, it's kind of interesting because I'm simultaneously underselling them.

actually kind of incredible <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=252' target='__blank'>00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,480</a> that you can get so much emergent magical behavior out of them despite them being so simple <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=256' target='__blank'>00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,480</a> mathematically.

of just juxtapose together. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=262' target='__blank'>00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,280</a> And I think basically what it is is we are actually fairly good at optimizing these neural <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=266' target='__blank'>00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:31,720</a> nets and when you give them a hard enough problem, they are forced to learn very interesting <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=271' target='__blank'>00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,400</a>

after formation of <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=795' target='__blank'>00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,600</a> Earth, if I'm recurrently just a few hundred

the constraint, that is not the limiting variable <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=806' target='__blank'>00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,920</a> and that life should actually be fairly common. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=809' target='__blank'>00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:35,480</a> And then where the drop offs are is very interesting to think about. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=815' target='__blank'>00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:39,040</a> I currently think that there's no major

reconcile the fact that <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=824' target='__blank'>00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:49,840</a> we haven't found anyone and so on is that we just can't, we can't see them. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=829' target='__blank'>00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,840</a> We can't observe them.

to, they really <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=835' target='__blank'>00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:01,240</a> seem to think that the jump from bacteria to more complex organisms is the hardest jump. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=841' target='__blank'>00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,560</a> The you carry it like this.

that difficult like an ability in years is not even that <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=863' target='__blank'>00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:30,240</a> long of a

00:14:32,000</a> I'm sure they can invent more complex. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=872' target='__blank'>00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,240</a> I don't

href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=895' target='__blank'>00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,120</a> Well, it's just, we don't have really good mechanisms for seeing this life.

href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=901' target='__blank'>00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:05,760</a> So I'm not an expert just to preface this, but just from what I mean at it was, I want

there and to find <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=912' target='__blank'>00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:16,480</a> these earth like radio waves, for example, are terrible. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=916' target='__blank'>00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,280</a> Their power drops off as basically one over our square. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=919' target='__blank'>00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:25,360</a> So I remember reading that our current radio waves would not be the ones that we are broadcasting <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=925' target='__blank'>00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,960</a> would not be measurable by our devices today. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=928' target='__blank'>00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,040</a> Only like, was it like one tenth of a light year away? <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=931' target='__blank'>00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:36,280</a> Like not even basically tiny distance because you really need like a targeted transmission <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=936' target='__blank'>00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:41,520</a> of massive power directed somewhere for this to be picked up on long distances. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=941' target='__blank'>00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:45,040</a> And so I just think that our ability to measure is not amazing. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=945' target='__blank'>00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,200</a> I think there's probably other civilizations out there. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=947' target='__blank'>00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,800</a> And then the big question is why don't they build one moment probes and why don't they <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=949' target='__blank'>00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,720</a> interstellar travel across the entire galaxy? <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=952' target='__blank'>00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,640</a> And my current answer is it's probably interstellar travel is like really hard. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=956' target='__blank'>00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,720</a> You have the interstellar medium. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=957' target='__blank'>00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,640</a> If you want to move at close to speed of light, you're going to be encountering bullets <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=960' target='__blank'>00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:06,240</a> along the way because even like tiny hydrogen atoms and particles of dust are basically <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=966' target='__blank'>00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,640</a> have like massive kinetic energy at those speeds. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=969' target='__blank'>00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:14,000</a> And so basically you need some kind of shielding, you need that you have all the cosmic radiation. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=974' target='__blank'>00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,200</a> It's just like brutal out there. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=975' target='__blank'>00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,200</a> It's really hard. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=976' target='__blank'>00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,160</a> And so my thinking is maybe interstellar travel is just extremely hard. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=979' target='__blank'>00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:24,240</a> And you have to build years to build hard. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=984' target='__blank'>00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,600</a> It feels like it feels like we're not a billion years away from doing that.

potentially as an example <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=992' target='__blank'>00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,920</a> through space. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=993' target='__blank'>00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,920</a> Right. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=994' target='__blank'>00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,600</a> I was supposed to close this speed of light. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=996'

target='__blank'>00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:08,200</a> Or they're all just independent, they're all just like little pockets. <br/></body></html><a

href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=2320' target='__blank'>00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:46,000</a> Think of it as a, so basically a transformer is a series of blocks, right? <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=2326' target='__blank'>00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,760</a> And these blocks have attention and a little multi-layer perceptron.

href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=2333' target='__blank'>00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:56,160</a> And then you have a number of layers arranged sequentially. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=2336' target='__blank'>00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:00,160</a> And so the way to look at it, I think, is because of the residual pathway in the backward

that in the beginning and during initialization, <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=2358' target='__blank'>00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,600</a> they contribute

href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=2386' target='__blank'>00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:51,000</a> And I kind of feel like because of the residual pathway and the dynamics of the optimization, <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=2391' target='__blank'>00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,440</a> you can sort of learn a very short algorithm that gets the approximate answer. <br/></body></html><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0&t=2394' target='__blank'>00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:57,840</a> But then the other layers can sort of kick in
